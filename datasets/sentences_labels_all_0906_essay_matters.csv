So with this roller coaster you are trying to build.For us to build this roller coaster we need some safety requirements.Some of these will be or initial drop height or hill height even the weight of our car these will make the energy change and be bigger and smaller.,P5_06_17_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
First we will talk about or roller coasters initial drop and hill height.For our heights we will have to make our initial drop height taller than our hill height.,P5_06_17_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,acceptable,unacceptable
The reason for this is because with the first drop we need to create a amount of energy to get over the hill so if our hill is the same height or taller than the initial drop or car will not get over.,P5_06_17_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
Here is some evidence we did some tests we keep or initial drop height at 5.00 meters.So we put or hill height at 4.01 meters and it created 2448 Joules of energy and made it over the hill.But when we put the hill height at 5.00 meters it created more energy that was 2449 joules of energy and it didn't make it over the hill.,P5_06_17_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
So this shows that our hill height needs to be smaller than the initial drop height.,P5_06_17_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
We do need some things that might help our roller coaster to be fun.,P5_06_17_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
We might want our initial drop height to be pretty tall it would create lots of Potential energy at the top of the drop and it will turn into ken-tic energy at the bottom.,P5_06_17_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
While this energy transfers between kinetic and potinel because we cant destroy or create energy can only transfer it that is what the law of conversation of energy says.,P5_06_17_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,acceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
This will create more energy for this coaster to be more fun and have more inversions.,P5_06_17_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable

Also when the car goes down the initial drop the energy starts out as potential at the top of the hill but when it starts going down it transfers to kinetic energy.Here is some evidence we did some tests we keep or initial drop height at 5.00 meters.So we put or hill height at 4.01 meters and it created 2448 Joules of energy and made it over the hill.But when we put the hill height at 5.00 meters it created more energy that was 2449 joules of energy and it didn't make it over the hill.,P5_06_17_22-23,E1,unacceptable,acceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable

I think the initial drop height should be 60 m and then have a hill that is 50 m tall and I will explain to you why I think this.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
You said you wanted an exciting roller coaster so I made the drop height 60 m. I didn't want to make it too tall and have it take up too much space but I also didn't want it to be boring.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
Then there will be a hill of 50 m. The reason I have the hill as 50 m is because a hill has to be shorter than initial drop height because otherwise there won't be enough energy to go over the hill.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,acceptable,unacceptable
For example when I did an Initial Drop height of 5 m and had a hill height of 5 m it didn't go over the hill because it did not have enough energy.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
For example when I had a drop height.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
The amount of energy there is depends on how much PE and KE there is.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
Because PE and KE added together equal the total amount of energy.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,acceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
And the initial drop affects the amount of PE because the higher the drop height the larger amount of PE there is.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,acceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
And the more PE there is at the top the more KE there is at the bottom of the drop because all the PE from the top transfers to KE.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,acceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
This happens because the Law of Conservation of Energy which means that energy cannot be created or destroyed it can only be transferred.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,acceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
So since the total amount of energy is the PE and KE combined the total energy never changes because the energy is only transferred.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,acceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable

You said you wanted an exciting roller coaster so I made the drop height 5 m. You said you wanted an exciting ride so I put the drop height as 5 m. Because it was the highest it could be and it had the most energy.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
For example when I had a drop height of 2.5 the PE at the top was 1222 J and the KE was 0 J.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
At the bottom the KE was 1221 J and the PE was 1 J.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
It had a total energy of 1222 J.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable

At the bottom the KE was 2442 J and the PE was 1 J.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
And it had a total energy of 2443.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
So the 5 m tall drop had 1221 J of energy more than the 2.5 m tall drop.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
Then there will be a hill of 4 m. The reason I have the hill as 4 m is because a hill has to be shorter than initial drop height because otherwise there won't be enough energy to go over the hill.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,acceptable,unacceptable
Because at the initial drop the PE was 2450 J and the KE was 0 J.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable

And because of this it wasn't able to go over the hill because it didn't have enough energy.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
But when the hill height was 4 it was able to go over.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
Because at the initial drop the PE was 2448 J and the KE was 0 J.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
Then at the top of the hill the PE was 1959 J and the KE was 489 J and had enough energy to go up the hill.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
The amount of total energy depends on how much PE and KE there is.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
Because PE and KE added together equals the total amount of energy.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,acceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
And the more PE there is at the top the more KE there is at the bottom of the drop.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
This is because all the PE from the top transfers to KE.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,acceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
Then there will be a loop and the reason it is 4 m is the same reason as the hill.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable

"First, we did the initial drop we learned that potential energy turned into kinetic energy.",P5_03_03_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable

Then we studied hills and we learned if the hill is the same height or bigger than the initial drop the cart doesn't have enough kinetic energy to make it over the hill we also learned that the bigger the hill the more pe as shown with test trials with 5m and 4m hills 5 had 2443 Jules and 4 had 1961 Jules.,P5_03_03_22-23,E1,acceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,acceptable,unacceptable
