620,"It involves science, technology, and physics and it will be able to make it to the end with pure thrill in the costumer's eyes.",0
374,Now lets say that it weighs 60 kg then the amount of PE will be larger at 2937 J.,0
489,Then when it makes it way down it changes into kinetic energy to continue on with the ride.,0
156,I would also recommend a car with a big mass.,0
588,So of you apply all of this to your roller coasters it will surely be fun and safe for everyone.,0
314,At the top the KE is low and at the bottom the KE is high because the PE has turned into KE.,0
38,"All of these trials were conducted without friction, but I know that there would be friction in the real world.",0
285,This is because PE is stored in an object.,0
704,"Because total energy is just all the different types of energy added up, the total energy stayed the same this entire time.",0
438,"If the Gonzales family added the 3.00 m hill, the ride would be more fun, but still make it to the end of the ride.",0
468,"During these simulations, with the law of conservation of energy..",1
86,"For example, in my data on Adding hills, when I set the hill height to 5.0 m and the initial drop to 5.0 m. The cart was not able to make it over the hill because there wasn't enough total energy, PE, and KE.",1
773,"The reason we picked 4 metres for our initial drop height is that a hill height of 4 metres or more is pretty dang tall, and we feel like it couldn't be very safe for a high hill height.",1
277,"E1R: We started at a release height of 2 meters then we tested the height at 3,4 and then 5 meters.",1
511,But when i tested the height of 3 the total energy was 1466.,1
731,This was because the friction changed into an external source of energy that can no longer be used.,1
324,"When I increased the drop height to 4 meters, the PE increased at 2166 Joules.",1
519,The mass of the car is also very important.,1
69,"For example, in my data on Adding hills, when I set the hill height to 5.0 m and the initial drop to 5.0 m. The cart was not able to make it over the hill because there wasn't enough total energy, PE, and KE.",1
789,"If our cart is 40 kilograms, it would glide through the track but not really gather a lot of potential energy due to its lightweight.",1
