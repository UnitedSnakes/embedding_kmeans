340,"According to my data when the initial drop was 3m the amount of potential energy there was, was 1466J compared to the 5m initial drop height which was 2932 J of potential energy.",0
264,These are the current suggestions I have provided for the roller coaster that is desired.,0
239,"Now for my first example, the initial drop is going to be at 5.0 kg, with the cart being 50 kg, the PE at 2443 J and the KE at 0 J.",0
773,"We found that this happens since there isn't enough KE to make it over the hill since the energy has to be split in between KE and PE, we had to make it 4 m. The Law of Conservation of Energy says that Energy can't be created or destroyed only changed, and that is also the reason we can't make the hill height and the initial drop the same.",0
28,in the simulation i used had no friction so there was no heat or sound energy.,0
788,When we tested 5.01 meters the cart was not able to go over.,0
466,This helped us decide where we should start our roller coaster and where to put the hills.,0
9,that's why when the cart got to the bottom the ke was 977 joules for the first trial and 2442 joules for the second.,0
775,"Then in a different test where the mass was 50 kg and the mass was 2,446 J.",0
393,"In the last experiment I ran, the hill was the same height as the initial drop (5 m) but it was the only one whose coaster car didn't make it over the hill.",0
568,This is important for the car to be able to make it to the top of the hill.,1
412,then the ride would go through a 360-turn bringing back all the potential energy to then go into a 35ft hill.,1
39,by making it so its 50kg you get the benefit of more energy but don't have to worry as much on the friction.,1
738,This is because with the initial drop at 5 meters if we make the hill too high the cart won't make it up the hill.,1
181,On the hill there will be very little PE but a lot of KE.,1
413,The ride would not be able to go up because of the number of tests we have done before this ride and have total energy needed to make the hill.,1
414,Then the ride would move backward through the track bringing back all the total energy that was used to try to make it up the hill.,1
142,The height of the initial drop was 5.,1
645,"With an initial drop height of 4.5 meters and a hill height of 4 meters, the coaster was able to make it to the end.",1
662,Potential energy is the stored energy that matter can use to make things happenâ€”when the time comes.,1
