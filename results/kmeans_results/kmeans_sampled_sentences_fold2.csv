262,It represents the overall energy content of the system at any given point during the ride.,0
569,To have more energy the height of the initial drop must be high.,0
38,E1: The science behind why my current roller coaster design will be exciting and will make it to the end of the ride without stopping.,0
61,The law of conservation of energy is how much energy you need to go around the entire roller coaster without using your own energy.,0
202,"This process continues as the coaster goes through the various hills, drops, and loops of the ride.",0
395,The car changes because when the car goes down the initial drop PE and KE stays the same.,0
298,"E1R: Hey, Mr. Gonzales I've created a roller coaster design for you.",0
355,Initial drop is important while making a roller coaster.,0
28,"That means that the energy never goes away, there is always energy.",0
408,My suggestion for your roller coaster would be to make its drop height high.,0
152,"In my trial, when the car weighed 44 kg, the total energy was 1723 J.",1
811,"The relationship between mass, Pe and KE is very intrestiong.",1
403,I also tried it with a higher mass with 60g and it was 2938 for PE and KE was 2908.,1
469,E1R: The drop height of my rollercoaster will be 5 meters.,1
707,During the start of the cart the PE was 1955 and when it began to go down the hill the PE amount would switch.,1
460,Why?,1
103,"So that shows that the relationship between release height and PE is when the release height is higher, the total energy is higher.",1
234,"First, we need to make sure we have a safe initial drop.",1
523,E1R: the past few days I have been doing lots of test notes and data to find the best roller coaster that live up to expectation.,1
