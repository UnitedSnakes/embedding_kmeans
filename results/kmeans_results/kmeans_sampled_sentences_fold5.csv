486,In my simulator when I tested the 5.00 drop and the 5.00 hill the cart didn't make it over.,0
599,"For example, when I tested the drop height of 2 meters, the PE was 1173 at the top of the drop.",0
403,E1R: I recommend that the Gonzales family could make the roller coaster last longer to make people think that they are getting their money's worth.,0
588,"My second recommendation is a kart mass of 51kg, mass and energy have direct relationship.",0
648,This height would give the fastest speeds possible while being safe.,0
62,The reason for this is that we think it will be most exciting for the riders because it was the highest option and also because you will gain the most speed from dropping from that height than you would on anything lower.,0
453,But when my hill was at 4m with my initial drop being 5m the cart made it to the end.,0
527,"E1: During my proposal to the Gonzales family, I will be sharing my findings about:",0
267,"E1R: I would recommend to make the initial drop 5 m because then the PE will be higher, meaning more PE at the beginning the same KE at the end.",0
341,"E1: Dear Gonzalez family,",0
458,When thinking of energy the only way for the cart to make it to the end is to have a high and fast initial drop.,1
331,And the more PE there is at the top the more KE there is at the bottom of the drop.,1
344,My proposal is to make a roller coaster with the highest initial drop height possible.,1
54,"So, for example, energy throughout a roller coaster is not getting destroyed it's either switching or the friction is turning into mechanical energy which turns into other forms of energy like heat+ thermal energy, and sound energy.",1
755,Potential energy can be defined as the energy stored in an object which transforms into kinetic energy when in motion.,1
251,The height of 2 m had a PE of 997 J.,1
487,But when I tested the 5.00 drop and the 2.00 it would be a boring ride.The best option to put the hill at is 4.25 because it was shorter than the 5.00 initial drop but high enough to still be thrilling.,1
381,When the car mass is 50 the PE top of the initial drop (5m) would be 1958 J and KE bottom of Drop would be 1955 J.,1
291,For example when I had a drop height.,1
457,You also need to have enough energy from the initial drop to make it all the way to the end of the roller coaster.,1
