834,"For instance when the drop height was 3.5m, the car only made it to the end when the hill height was 2m."
303,The law of conservation of energy is when the cart stays at the same speed for a period of time.
782,"Next, we tried 4 meters and got 1955J of PE and 0J of KE at the top, then at the bottom 1954J of KE and 1J PE."
589,"This shows that the greater the height of the initial drop, the greater the PE at the top of the drop, the KE at the bottom, and the TE."
122,"This change occurs due to the cart's increased speed as it moves downhill, which is caused by its mass."
617,I tested this zero friction that is not real and cant happen
258,Mass of the cart is also very important.
194,When i changed the weight to 45 kg the PE was 2213 at the top.
321,The reason I said the height of your intial drop should be so tall is so you can get the most energy out of it and it will be more fun to to ride.
384,(The mass doesn't affect the ability or inability to get over hills so it won't harm the coaster experience.)
798,"For example, when I tested the drop height of 4 meters, the PE was 1955 but when I increased the drop to 5 meters the PE increased meaning it was able to go up our 4 meter hill and go through loops."
392,"Proof of this is in the ""Add a Hill"" experiment."
343,As you can see the greater height allowed for the potential energy to change into kinetic energy with more than the smaller height amount.
138,When the car mass was 40kg the total energy was 1958 J. when the car mass was 60kg the total energy was 2937 J. at the initial drop its a PE and at the bottom of the drop it is mostly KE with a couple PE J.
633,"Starting from the steep initial drop, you'll start off pretty fast and then you'll go through a loop."
340,"According to my data when the initial drop was 3m the amount of potential energy there was, was 1466J compared to the 5m initial drop height which was 2932 J of potential energy."
498,"With a 5m drop our simulations showed that the PE was 2932 with a 60kg cart, we only tested the drop height we did not test a full ride or add anything else."
771,"In a different test when the initial height was 4 m, the PE was 1,955 J, then the bottom height being 0 m, the PE was 1 J."
119,"The greater the potential energy, the greater the kinetic energy, resulting in a greater effect on the total amount of energy."
13,so starting with a higher amount of energy means you'll end with that energy.
468,When a car is dropped at 3.50m the PE was at 1710j and the KE was at 0j.
113,"Based on research, it has been determined that the most efficient height for a roller coaster design is an initial height of 5.00."
470,Once the car gets to the bottom of the roller coaster the KE is at 1710j and the PE is at 0j.
102,"At the top of the initial drop, the potential energy would be 2243, while the kinetic energy would be at 0."
708,"With a car mass of 40 kilograms, the car had 1,959 joules of total energy throughout the ride."
475,The car that weighed 60 kg had 2642j.
251,"E1: There are certain factors to consider, the mass of the cart and the height of the drop and hill."
410,The ride would move through twists and turns giving the ride around 2250J potential energy.
681,"This run had a total energy of 2,254 joules."
39,by making it so its 50kg you get the benefit of more energy but don't have to worry as much on the friction.
818,"When I increased the height to 5m, the KE increased to 2442 Joules."
103,"As the cart starts to move down the hill, the kinetic energy would be 2243, and the potential energy would be 0."
248,"In conclusion, to make a roller coaster using physics, you must include:
- Initial drop."
650,"This is because the car had converted all 2,558 joules of kinetic energy back to potential energy before the car could even make it to the top of the hill."
726,for example our data shows that when the hill is 3 meters the cart will make it up the hill with an initial drop height of 5 meters.
292,I came up with is the ride will have a 4.05(m) release height.
173,THANK YOU
518,The kinetic energy at the bottom was 977 J but while it was at the top it was zero.
293,At the top of the release drop the PE will be at 1585(J) and the KE will be at 0(J).
227,Roller coasters need some way to get energy to make it to the end of it.
234,"Once the roller coaster starts moving down your initial drop, that's when things start to get fun."
497,"In a frictionless world the PE and KE would be the same at the bottom of the drop, we saw this in our simulations."
697,"With the same drop height but with a hill that's 5 meters tall, the coaster car had 0 joules of kinetic energy before it even made it to the top."
128,"E1: In order to have a safe and exiting ride you will need to have an initial drop, a hill, and mass and energy."
781,Then at the bottom the KE was 1456J and PE was 1.
3,"for example when getting data at the top of the drop with the height of 2 meter the PE was at 977 joules of energy at the top, with the KE of 0 joules."
811,"To fine the conservation of KE is, mass times speed times speed divide by two."
377,"proof of this is in the ""Add a Hill"" experiment."
404,Then the ride would start to move backward back through the 360 turn and back through the loop and back to where they started.
599,All of these trials were tested on a frictionless track.
843,"Next, I noticed that PE+KE=TE."
151,The potential energy is the energy that is being stored in an object.
669,"At the top of an initial drop of 2 meters, the car had 1,134 joules of potential energy and 0 joules of kinetic."
653,"In conclusion, my roller coaster design will be really fun, plus the car will be able to make it to the end without backtracking at the same time."
38,the 50kg had 2443. the 60kg had 2932 joules.
450,All of these tests were done in a friction less environment.
250,"(If included)
- Make sure the car gets enough energy to make it through the end."
590,"Also, I would recommend a hill height of 3.5 meters off the ground."
57,"In conclusion as explained through the data, for the best roller coaster results we suggest an initial drop of 5 meters, a hill height of 3.75 m, and a car mass of 60 kg, the riders will be safe, thrilled, and happy with their roller coaster experience!"
365,This was proven in our simulation when the mass was 50 kg and the TE was 2445 J and the mass was 60 kg and the TE was 2934 J.
131,When the height of the hill was 3.20 (lower) the car went over the hill.
615,The relationship between drop height and hill height because the hill height is when it is at the very top and the drop height is when it is droping down.
164,The hill going up is going up at a 90 degree angle and will flip going into a loop there will be no PE but lots of KE.
508,With a 5m drop our simulations showed that the PE was 2932 with a 60kg cart this is because mass and energy are related.
501,PE transfers to KE when the cart is moving.
412,then the ride would go through a 360-turn bringing back all the potential energy to then go into a 35ft hill.
479,When you are building the new roller coaster make sure that the hill height is smaller than the drop.
735,For example in our data when the mass was 40kg the total energy was 1955j but when we had a mass of 60kg the total energy was 2933.
232,"The initial drop is the starting point, the higher it is, then its a better chance at making it to the end."
666,This means the car will be moving as fast as it ever has.
115,It is important to ensure that the hill height is not greater than the hill itself.
558,"At the bottom of the drop pe is 1 and ke is 2930 Throughout the ride, the total energy remains the same yet the energy just changes forms."
93,"E1R: Dear Gonzales family,we have come up with the best possible design for your coaster.We have figured out the best way to make sure the coaster will be safe but also fun."
672,"My roller coaster design has a high drop height that will maximize the amount of kinetic energy, therefore speed and fun, during the ride."
301,The car changes from PE to KE so it can slow down when going downhill and then gets more PE the get speed to go back up.
51,To get over the hill you need a large amount of Kinetic Energy and to get that Kinetic Energy you have to start with that same amount of potential energy which you can only get from the initial drop.
285,For us to build this roller coaster we need some safety requirements.Some of these will be or initial drop height or hill height even the weight of our car these will make the energy change and be bigger and smaller.
444,The height of my hill was 4 meters because it was the highest I could have before it wouldn't make it over the hill because of the height.
7,or into other types of energy like sound and or heat.
810,To find the PE you have to times the mass and the height times 9.8.
561,The drop height of my roller coaster is 4.15 meters.
799,When I tested the roller coaster the PE and the KE were almost always stayed the same.
578,For example the 3.98 m roller coaster will have a 1946 J of energy but the 5.00 m roller coaster had 2443 so that proves the higher the roller coaster the bigger the energy and vise versa.
754,"Keep in mind that the tests we are doing are in a frictionless environment, so this data wouldn't be the same as if it was in the real world."
429,"This is because there is more of the object going down the hill, which increases energy and therefore speed."
473,The car that had the most mass had more total energy than the cars with a smaller mass.
144,when the height of the hill was 5 (same) the car didn't go over the hill.
354,"I know that because when my simulation was at 4 meters, the PE at the top was 1564 Joules and the KE at the bottom was 1563 Joules."
367,"I know that because when my simulation was at 4 meters, the PE at the top was 1564 Joules."
792,"For example when we used 40kg for weight the PE was 1955J, at the initial drop, and the 1951J of KE at the bottom of the drop."
172,I hope you pick my roller coaster.
214,"Once the cart starts to move down, both the PE and KE start to decrease and increase."
53,Our most recent study was investigating which mass for the car would be the best at providing energy.
478,This means that we should start our roller coaster at a higher drop.
616,That the lighter the mass is it will have a better PE because it weighs less.
104,These two forms of energy have a significant impact on the total amount of energy.
844,"No matter what, the TE remained the same throughout the entire trial."
775,"Then in a different test where the mass was 50 kg and the mass was 2,446 J."
371,"Within the drop, those roles were reversed and the end PE was 1 J and the end KE was 1172 J."
208,"Once the roller coaster starts moving down your initial drop, that's when things start to get fun."
709,"With car mass set to 60 kilograms, the car had 2,939 joules of total energy."
171,There will be no phone allowed and we will hold them tight for the m in compartments behind the ticket counter.
29,that's why when the cart got to the bottom the ke was 977 joules for the first trial and 2442 joules for the second.
181,On the hill there will be very little PE but a lot of KE.
196,People will need safety goggles and tight safety bars to hold them in.
438,"At the bottom of the 5 meters the KE was 2442 Joules, and the drop height of 4 had a KE of 1954 Joules."
715,"Plus, we've implicitly seen how the roller coaster can be fun for visitors to your park."
139,"My roller coaster design will be exiting because it will be fast have hills, and will make it to the end of the ride."
651,"My roller coaster design has a drop height greater than the height of the loop, so it will be able to make it after the loop."
238,Both the PE and KE are measured in J(Joules).
130,The height of the initial drop was 5.
841,E1R: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
120,"If a coaster cart with a mass of 60 begins to move downhill, there is a change in both its kinetic and potential energy."
710,That's 980 more joules of total energy than the run with 40 kilograms.
693,"If the hill height is equal to or higher than the drop height, the car won't be able to make it to the end of the ride."
481,Also the more the car weighs the more total energy it will have.
195,"At the bottom the KE was 2208 with a total energy of 2213

The roller coaster will be about 2 minutes long and i will charge 11 dollars a person."
108,"This change occurs due to the cart's increased speed as it moves downhill, which is caused by its mass."
295,"The total energy changes from PE to KE, Many times throughout the ride."
764,"While just testing with the initial drop of 5 m, at the top of the initial drop total energy was 2,443 J."
459,The higher the drop point affects how much PE and KE you have while on the ride.
793,"On the other hand a 60kg cart had 2933J of PE at the initial drop, 2927J of KE at the bottom and the total energy being 2933J."
812,E1: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
198,I hope you pick my roller coaster.
298,"E1R: Dear, the Gonzales Family"
688,This is because the initial drop height is higher than the highest point along the track.
517,While at the bottom it was 0 J.
610,E1: The drop height when changed changes the PE for example when i had a release height of 5 meters beside 4 meters the 5 meter one had a higher PE because the higher you go up the better PE it has.
336,E1R: My recommendation to you Gonzales family is you make your initial drop height 5m tall.
790,"We decided to go with 3 meters because at the top of the hill the PE was 1471J and KE was 975J with a total of 2446J, making the cart able to go over the hill."
457,You will have to follow the Law of Conservation of Energy.
37,the trial with 40kg had 1955 joules of TE.
414,Then the ride would move backward through the track bringing back all the total energy that was used to try to make it up the hill.
397,If I were to design a roller coaster for Gonzales Park.
731,For example in our data when the hill height was 5m the PE at the top of the hill was 2449j but then when the cart gets to the top of the hill not all the KE transfers into PE.
403,And then a 360-degree turn and then go into a hill which the ride would not be able to go up.
751,We decided to do 5 m since that is the highest height we could do.
766,"In a different test where the initial drop was 4 m, the total energy at the top of the initial drop was 1,955 J, then at the bottom of the initial drop the total energy was 1,955 J."
603,This means that there will be less and less PE and KE as the ride goes on.
291,"The first thing is height everyone is looking for a tall, fast, stomach-dropping ride."
401,Then it will have a gassed-powered start to make it go from 0-70 in 1-2 seconds(We will give a warning of course).
440,The PE and KE change and transfer to one another but never is destroyed.
454,E1R: The initial drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters tall.
270,At 60 kg it had 2934 J at the top of the initial drop.
800,This was because the track was friction less.
609,"As the car goes down the tracks, energy is converted from PE to KE and back again but the total energy always stays the same."
526,"However, when the hill height was 3 meters high it went over the hill."
416,Before making the ride we made many tests and we lowered the total energy from 3000J to 2400J to make the ride safe for others.
329,According to my trials the hill of 3m had 1768J of potential energy and 582J of kinetic where as 4.5 had 2276J potential energy but only 73J of kinetic energy.
712,There we go!
167,When going down there will be lots of PE and a lot of KE.
177,Then there is a hill that you go up at at a 90 degree angle.
224,"(If included)
- Make sure the car gets enough energy to make it through the end."
306,E1: Dear Gonzalez family
8,in the simulation i used had no friction so there was no heat or sound energy.
342,"In my data the initial drop of 3m had 1465J of Kinetic energy at the end of the drop, where the 5m initial drop had 2930J of kinetic energy."
642,"Since the top of the loop is lower than the initial drop, the car will be able to make it over."
461,When I drop the car at 5.00m height the PE at the top was 2443j.
626,and at the bottom it had 0 PE the Ke had 0 at the top and at the bottom it had 2668 Ke this shows that the PE gave Ke all the energy.
451,I know that in the real world there is friction to account for.
443,Because if the hill is the same or taller than the initial drop the car wouldn't have the energy to make it up the hill.
400,Then they will move into a room where they take an elevator to a platform where the ride starts.
203,Lets make a roller coaster that uses physics.
296,This makes it speed it and slow down
56,As previously explained to have the best experience you need a lot of energy and the mass of 60 kg does that.
55,"However the lowest mass we tested of 40 kg with every other aspect also remaining the same, we saw a potential energy of 1959 J."
125,"For instance, if the initial drop height is 4.59 and the hill height is 5.00, the coaster cart won't be able to go over the hill."
667,We can see how the initial drop height has an effect on energy using data from Initial Drop.
744,E1: My team and I have come up with a couple ideas for the roller coaster for you and your family's park.
116,"At the top of the initial drop, the potential energy would be 2243, while the kinetic energy would be at 0."
15,but if you have more mass then there is more friction so it might not ride as smooth.
278,We might want our initial drop height to be pretty tall it would create lots of Potential energy at the top of the drop and it will turn into ken-tic energy at the bottom.
701,"My roller coaster design's drop height is higher than the highest point along the ride, as stated previously."
728,So we can infer that the hill has to be a smaller height than your initial drop.
593,This data shows that the car has enough energy to make it up and over the hill and will make it to the end of the ride.
356,"Showing that when the height goes up, so does the total energy."
784,"This shows like that I said, the more height there is the more energy there will be, making it so the roller coaster can make it until the end."
706,We can see how the coaster car has more energy using data from Mass & Energy.
769,"Height and PE have a direct relationship meaning that if the height goes down the PE goes down, and if the height goes up the PE goes up."
140,"E1R: In order to have a safe and exiting ride you will need to have an initial drop, a hill, and mass and energy."
544,The car at the top of the hill stopped has all of its energy as potential energy waiting to be spent.
430,"In conclusion, there are a few steps you need to follow in order to make the roller coaster ride as fun as possible."
554,You must ensure you have enough energy to get over the hills.
132,when the height of the hill was 5 (same) the car didn't go over the hill.
28,in the simulation i used had no friction so there was no heat or sound energy.
314,"First, we did the initial drop we learned that potential energy turned into kinetic energy as stated in trials 1,2,3, and 4 in trial 1 there was 2443 pe and 0 ke but at the bottom, there were 2443 ke and 0 pe."
462,"At the bottom, the KE was 2442j."
512,At the bottom of a drop the KE was the same as the PE at the top of the drop with no friction.
327,"I recommend a height of about 3m, you maybe wondering why it can't be higher then the intial car , and we'll it can but then the coaster car can't make it over the hill, not allowing it to finish the track."
325,"As you can see the greater height allowed for the potential energy to change into kinetic energy with more than the smaller height amount, making the greater height a better option for your roller coasters intial drop."
427,"In a frictionless environment, it will put in the exact same amount of energy going down the initial drop as it will going up the hill, meaning it is unable to get over the hill."
352,Whereas the amount the car with a mass of 60kg had 2934J of potential energy at the initial drop height.
200,"E1: Hello Gonzales family, I will be talking about how our roller coaster design will be the best for your entertainment."
380,It's also worth mentioning that the two coaster cars had the same amount of total energy at 2449 js so the energy didn't have anything to do with the coaster car at the 5 m hill not going over.
326,The next part in your roller coaster is going to be a hill.
765,"Then at the bottom of the initial drop, the total energy was also 2,443 J."
294,At the bottom of the release drop now the PE is at 1(J) and the KE is at 1584(J).
10,both with a pe of 0 joules.
805,When you have greater mass it will always effect the PE and KE.
411,the ride then meets a 25-foot hill using all the potential energy and making it convert into kinetic energy to around 2100J.
489,For example in my trial the drop height for both simulations was 3.50 and the hill height was 3.25 and when the 60 kg cart had 2054 jolts of potential energy while the 40 kg had 978 witch proves the heavier the cart the more energy making it easier to get to the top of the hill.
831,"No energy is lost or created, it is just transferred into PE or KE."
757,Then in a different test where the mass was 50 kg and the mass was 2446 J.
142,The height of the initial drop was 5.
408,If I were to design a roller coaster would make the start an elevator where the roller coaster moves up 35 feet to a gassed-powered start.
606,"E1R: First, I would recommend that the roller coaster car begins at an initial drop height of 5 meters off the ground."
284,So with this roller coaster you are trying to build.
275,Here is some evidence we did some tests we keep or initial drop height at 5.00 meters.So we put or hill height at 4.01 meters and it created 2448 Joules of energy and made it over the hill.But when we put the hill height at 5.00 meters it created more energy that was 2449 joules of energy and it didn't make it over the hill.
388,"At the top of the initial drop, all the energy is potential (gravitational potential energy to be specific) because the coaster car has the potential to go down the hill."
156,When the car mass was 40kg the total energy was 1958 J. when the car mass was 60kg the total energy was 2937 J. at the initial drop its a PE and at the bottom of the drop it is mostly KE with a couple PE J.
703,"The mass of the car of a roller coaster has an impact on the energy that the car has, however, it may not affect the speed of the roller coaster."
662,Potential energy is the stored energy that matter can use to make things happen—when the time comes.
778,Having more PE means we will also have more total energy and KE.
36,"for example in the simulation i use i did three trials the cart mass was 40, 50, and 60kg."
261,and at 60 kg it had 2934 J at the top of the initial drop.
696,"With a drop height of 4.5 meters and a hill height of 4 meters, the coaster car still had 276 joules of energy at the top of the hill that it could use to make it the rest of the way through the track."
254,"For example, In our data the initial drop had been at 5 and in the first trial and the hill at 2."
357,"With more total energy, our cars will have more PE at the beginning and more KE at the end."
222,"In conclusion, to make a roller coaster using physics, you must include:
- Initial drop."
127,"Based on research, it has been determined that the most efficient height for a roller coaster design is an initial height of 5.00."
493,In conclusion the design i will be fun and work because the the drop height is higher then the hill height .
154,All or most of the PE energy at the top of the initial drop will transform to KE as it goes down the drop.
483,The new car has to follow the Law of Conservation of Energy.
118,These two forms of energy have a significant impact on the total amount of energy.
522,"The height of the initial drop also plays into the energy because according to my data, while the release height was 2 meters the total energy was 977 J while at 5 meters the total energy was 2,442 J."
460,When the drop height is lower than the hill height the car will be unable to make it over the hill.
265,"E1R: There are certain factors to consider, the mass of the cart and the height of the drop and hill."
19,by making it so its 50kg you get the benefit of more energy but don't have to worrier as much on the friction.
847,"For instance, when the drop height was 3.5m, the car only made it to the end when the hill height was 2m."
564,"When increased the drop height to 4.15 meters, the PE increased to 2432 joules."
148,At the top of the initial drop of 2 the PE of 977 J.
720,When we increased the height of the drop to 3 meters the PE was 1466 joules.
180,When getting near the end of the loop you will go into a hill then right in to a drop.
835,"When the hill was 5m or 3.5m, the car did not make it to the end."
658,It's also designed in a way that the car will never roll backwards along the track so that the car will make it to the end without fail.
41,It has an initial drop of 5 meters.
0,"E1: when making your roller coaster you should make the drop height 5 meters, the hill height 3 meters, and the mass of the cart 50kg

first you should make the drop 5 meters because of the relationship between height and energy."
840,"I want to make sure I have enough energy to make it to the end and increasing mass will increase the energy, including both KE at the bottom and PE at the top."
344,The total energy of the height of the initial drop should be a lot and we can get that when we have the higher initial drop that is why I am suggesting 5m of an initial drop.
567,"E1R: During my proposal to the Gonzales family, I will be sharing my finding about the best way to design a roller coaster."
547,My design follows the requirements for energy with the drop being higher than both of the loops the cart can successfully make it to the end.
734,So this means that if you want the roller coaster to go faster you should make the mass of the cart larger.
445,For example with a hill height of 4 meters I got a PE of 1963 Joules.
27,or into other types of energy like sound and or heat.
111,"For instance, if the initial drop height is 4.59 and the hill height is 5.00, the coaster cart won't be able to go over the hill."
179,"The starting initial drop would be 50 m drop and the PE (potential energy) would be about 3,000 The hill going up is going up at a 90 degree angle and will flip going into a loop there will be no PE but lots of KE."
783,Finally we did 5 meters and got a PE of 2443J at the initial drop and KE with 1J PE at the bottom and 2442J of KE.
317,so to have a big ride that is fun you have to have a lot of potential energy at the top of the initial hill and a lot of kinetic energy at the bottom of the initial hill so I think that 5m would be the best hill for that potential energy to be turned into kinetic energy.
149,And as the car went down the drop the KE had 977 J and PE had 0 because all of the energy was transferred.
259,Depending on the ride the mass of the cart should be somewhere in the middle rather than lower or higher.
382,"In the ""Mass & energy"" experiment, I ran experiments with the lightest and heaviest car."
395,"In the ""Mass & Energy"" experiment, I ran experiments with the lightest and heaviest car."
23,"for example when getting data at the top of the drop with the height of 2 meter the PE was at 977 joules of energy at the top, with the KE of 0 joules."
417,"Compared to the other rides we have made in the past, like having a drop around 40 feet which we have lowered to around 35 feet to still keep it fun but not as dangerous as before."
529,"While when the mass was 60 kilograms, the total energy was 2,932."
207,"Along with the initial drop, there is also an energy called ""Potential energy"", that is going to be your start energy (Also your end!)."
511,Based on the data we also see that height and PE are related.
452,Friction will take some energy away from the car as it moves.
770,"In a test run where the initial height was 5 m and the PE was 2,443 J, then at the bottom of the initial drop, when the height would be about 0 m the PE was 1 J."
592,"In my trials, when I tested a hill height of 3.5 meters with an initial drop height of 5 meters, I found that the PE at the top of the hill was 1718 joules and the KE at the top of the hill was 729 joules."
559,"E1: During my proposal to the Gonzales family, I will be sharing my finding about the best way to design a roller coaster."
87,"E1: Dear Gonzales family,we have come up with the best possible design for your coaster.We have figured out the best way to make sure the coaster will be safe but also fun."
358,"For example, in a frictionless simulation, when the total energy was 1173 J, the start PE was 1173 J and the start KE was 0 J."
274,The reason for this is because with the first drop we need to create a amount of energy to get over the hill so if our hill is the same height or taller than the initial drop or car will not get over.
848,"So that is why my drop height will be 5m and my hill height will be 3m, since the hill height is less than my drop height."
714,We've seen from all of the data that my roller coaster won't have any flaws in functionality.
170,People will need safety goggles and tight safety bars to hold them in.
768,The amount of PE also relates to height.
625,also when i test the drop height was at 5 meters it had 2668 PE.
465,When the drop height was 4.50m and the will was 5.00m the car was unable to make it to the end of the track since the hill height needed more energy than the drop.
645,"With an initial drop height of 4.5 meters and a hill height of 4 meters, the coaster was able to make it to the end."
829,"This data also shows us how energy is transformed into PE to KE as the roller coaster goes along the track, but no energy is ever lost."
763,The law proves that you can not have more or less total energy than you started with.
649,"With an initial drop height of 4.5 meters and a hill height of 5 meters, the car couldn't make it to the end of the track."
655,I hope you will consider making my design a reality so that visitors can have a blast at your park!
575,"Because it starts at a drop and does a loop and goes straight and goes fast up a hill which is smaller than the drop, because then it would not make it up the hill and then you just be rocking back and forth."
216,Now adding a hill to the ride can be a little difficult if measurements are off to some extent.
187,One of my runs i put the hill height at 5 meters and the car wasn't able to make it but when i put the height at 3.63 meters it could make it.The PE at the top of the initial drop was 2446 and the KE was 0.
687,The amount of energy the car has decides whether or not it will make it to the end of the ride.
736,E1R: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
262,"In the middle, 50 kg would be perfect for a fun ride if loops and hills are the final goal design."
832,Another reason I will set my hill height as 3m is so the car will have enough energy to make it over the hill.
657,My roller coaster has a high drop height for maximum energy and speed throughout the ride.
838,"For instance, when I had 40kg as my mass, my PE at the top was 1955."
785,For the hill height we decided on 3 meters.
205,"Well, lets start off really high from the ground so we can use gravity for our power source, also known as the initial drop."
204,Now how does a roller coaster use physics?
690,The height of the initial drop versus the height of the highest hill on a track has the most impact on whether or not the coaster car will be able to make it to the end.
24,the drop with the height of 5 meters at the top had a PE of 2442 joules of energy at the top.
245,Mass is also a very important factor in physics.
700,"Therefore, the car will be able to make it to the end of the track."
16,"for example in the simulation i use i did three trials the cart mass was 40, 50, and 60kg."
30,both with a pe of 0 joules.
619,When the energy is being transfer.
240,"Once the cart starts to move down, both the PE and KE start to decrease and increase."
570,E1: Over the last week or so we have been studying what will be the best roller coaster and we have come up with some things that have limits before there are opposite reactions.
484,This shows us how more energy is not created as you go along the roller coaster and it's not taken away either.
338,For the mass of your car I recommend about 60kg in weight based on my investigations.
729,This is because when the energy transfers from PE to KE it won't be enough to get up the hill.
378,"In the last experiment, the hill was the same height as the initial drop (5 m) but it was the only one whose coaster car didn't make it over the hill."
223,- A hill that is shorter than the initial drop.
189,It made it over the hill.
565,PE+KE=TE
398,I would make it known for its speed and its enjoyability before you ride.
176,My roller coaster has a starting initial drop that no one will suspect.
618,E1R: The drop height when changed changes the PE for example when i had a release height of 5 meters beside 4 meters the 5 meter one had a higher PE because the higher you go up the better PE it has.
246,"For example, car A has a mass of 50 kg and car B has a mass of 60 kg and the same initial drop being at 4.0 m. Once the car is finished which every the car had the greater the mass, more the total energy."
105,"The greater the potential energy, the greater the kinetic energy, resulting in a greater effect on the total amount of energy."
550,E1R: Here are some recommendations I would give you for your roller coaster.
307,Here are my findings from our research on rollercoasters.
391,"The coaster car doesn't have enough kinetic energy to go up a hill the same size as the initial drop, much less one that is bigger."
22,by making it so the height is high you make it so the energy is high too.
490,In conclusion the design i will be fun and work because the the drop height is higher then the hill height
351,"For example, one of my tests was with a car that was 45kg the amount of energy it had at the beginning was 2182J."
499,At the bottom of the drop the KE was the same as the PE at the top of the drop.
815,"When I increased the height to 5m, the PE increased to 2443 Joules."
268,"Therefore the hill needs to be a bit less than the height of the drop, so it is still able to keep going if needed making it a more exciting ride."
527,The mass of the cart is also important for energy.
752,"We will then add a hill, with the height of around 4 m. We would have done 5 m, but in my data when testing a hill height of 5 m and a initial drop height of 5 m, we found that the coaster couldn't make it over the hill."
449,The KE was less too but still the PE and KE would inter change with each other.
157,"My roller coaster design will be exiting because it will be fast have hills, and will make it to the end of the ride."
256,"At the last trial the hill had been the same height as the drop, it only had 7 J of kinetic energy and did not make it to the end."
413,The ride would not be able to go up because of the number of tests we have done before this ride and have total energy needed to make the hill.
652,"After that first loop, the track keeps going downward, so the car is guaranteed to have enough kinetic energy to make it to the end of the track."
598,"Then when I tested a car mass of 60 kg, I found that the PE at the top of the drop was 2936 joules and the KE at the bottom was 2932 joules."
767,These two pieces of data show that the total energy stays the same throughout the whole ride.
660,The height of the initial drop on a roller coaster is a key factor that decides the amount of energy that a roller coaster will have throughout the ride.
6,at the bottom its the same the energy just converts to the opposite.
58,"Well wishes, more updates will be sent later in the study."
582,E1R: Over the last week or so we have been studying what will be the best roller coaster and we have come up with some things that have limits before there are opposite reactions.
635,"After wrapping around the track, you go underneath, wrap around that track again, and go down another steep drop, and the ride then ends."
673,The total energy within a ride is the same as the amount of potential energy at the start of the ride.
20,"E1R: when making your roller coaster you should make the drop height 5 meters, the hill height 3 meters, and the mass of the cart 50kg

first you should make the drop 5 meters because of the relationship between height and energy."
92,So after testing and putting all out data together we have coem up with the best design for your roller coaster.
823,I will be making the height of my hill 3m.
780,For example when the initial height was 3 meters the PE at the top was 1466J with the KE being 0J.
4,the drop with the height of 5 meters at the top had a PE of 2442 joules of energy at the top.
772,"These two test runs go to show that when the height goes up, the PE goes up and vise versa."
568,This is important for the car to be able to make it to the top of the hill.
436,For example when I tested the initial drop of 5 meters I got a PE (potential energy).
394,It's also worth mentioning that the two coaster cars in both experiments had the same amount of total energy at 2449 js so the energy didn't have anything to do with the coaster car at the 5 m hill not going over.
594,This is the best hill height because it guarantees that the car will get over the hill safely while still being high enough to be exciting for the riders.
396,"E1: Dear Gonzales Family,"
496,Mechanical Energy is letting the ride go through the track without extra pushes on the track.
312,So you can have a long fun and thrilling ride.
33,so starting with a higher amount of energy means you'll end with that energy.
683,"Add those together, and you get the total energy—2,254 joules."
363,"For example, when our drop and hill height were 5 meters, our car didn't make it to the end and just kept going up and down the hill."
98,Meaning it will be a more thrilling ride.For example in out data we discovered when we kept the initial drop height and hill height the same but changed the mass we got different total energy's.When we gave the cart a mass of 60kg it had 2938j but when we lower'd the mass of the cart to 40 kg it only had 1959j.
318,E1: My recommendation to you Gionzales family is you make your intial drop height 5m tall.
45,The first step in our design process is the initial drop.
226,will be the best for your entertainment.
328,I don't even recommend having it super high because the higher it is the less kinetic energy you have making the ride go slower that's why I recommend 3m.
817,"As for KE, when I test the drop height of 2m, the KE at the bottom was 977 Joules."
249,- A hill that is shorter than the initial drop.
721,Also the KE at the bottom of the hill will be larger when you increase the drop height.
620,and the law of conservation of mass states that energy can not be crated or destroy.
272,So with this roller coaster you are trying to build.For us to build this roller coaster we need some safety requirements.Some of these will be or initial drop height or hill height even the weight of our car these will make the energy change and be bigger and smaller.
723,The hill height for my roller coaster design is 3 meters.
535,E1: Here are some recommendations I would give you for your roller coaster.
822,"This shows that the more PE and KE, the more TE you have."
730,The total energy is always the same as the PE at the top of the initial drop but the KE is different at the top of the hill.
117,"As the cart starts to move down the hill, the kinetic energy would be 2243, and the potential energy would be 0."
528,"According to my data when the car mass was 40 kilograms the total energy was 1,955."
239,"Now for my first example, the initial drop is going to be at 5.0 kg, with the cart being 50 kg, the PE at 2443 J and the KE at 0 J."
774,"In a test I did where the mass of the car was 60 kg, the total energy was 2,936 J."
231,"Well, lets start off really high from the ground so we can use gravity for our power source, also known as the initial drop."
425,It would get to the top of the hill but would not go over it.
271,E1: Dear Gonzales family
826,"At the top of the drop, all the energy is PE, but as the car moves down the KE rises just as much as the PE falls."
505,"This is because we want there to be enough energy to get it over the hill our goal is to use mechanical energy to get the cart through the track, as said before this is not possible without extra pushe(s)."
588,"Then when I tested an initial drop height of 5 meters, I found that the PE at the top of the drop was 2443 joules and the KE at the bottom was 2442 joules."
221,"And the one with lower mass, then it has less energy."
540,"Energy cannot be created in a closed system, so you must ensure you have enough energy to get over the hills."
581,I believe that my roller coaster is the best roller coaster out there please pick mine!
313,E1R: Dear Gonzalez family
548,My design is fast and fun with a high drop height and a heavy cart.
694,This is because the car will have exhausted all of its kinetic energy before making it to the peak of the hill.
166,On the hill there will be very little PE but a lot of KE.
638,It also states that said energy can only be converted from one form to another.
126,"The amount of mass, potential energy, and kinetic energy are interrelated, as they all play a crucial role in assisting the coaster cart to traverse over the hill."
680,"Throughout all runs, the car had a mass of 58 kilograms and was dropped from 4.5 meters."
821,"When my height was set to 5m, the TE was 2443, meaning the KE at the bottom was 2442, and the PE is 1."
182,When going down there will be lots of PE and a lot of KE.
634,"After the loop, you pass through the middle of said loop and wrap around the track that leads up to the loop."
827,"For example, when my height was 5m for the drop, the PE started as 2443, and the KE as 0."
802,The car was moving the PE went down and the KE got larger.
290,"I believe that my idea would be a great addition to your park, attract a lot more people to come to your park."
711,"The mass of the car on my roller coaster design can simply be decided while it's being built, since in the end, it shouldn't really have much of an impact."
579,That mass and energy are related and can be changed from one to the other.
563,"For example, when I tested the drop height of 5 meters, the PE was 35 Joules."
704,"That could be because the car has more matter so it can store more energy, but that extra energy within that matter doesn't translate into the car moving faster."
9,that's why when the cart got to the bottom the ke was 977 joules for the first trial and 2442 joules for the second.
622,The relationship between drop height and hill height because the hill height is when it is at the very top and the drop height is when it is going down.
44,"Here's a look at the data we've collected, and our progress so far in our designs."
202,"Some may use power-boost energy, and others can just use physics."
347,So you can see there will be more speed if your hill is shorter but you also want it to be enjoyable so 3m is a good in between height.
415,Then the ride would move all through the track to where it would go down a hill back to the elevator.
692,This is because the car had enough kinetic energy left over to get over the peak after converting kinetic energy into potential energy going up the hill.
637,The Law of Conservation of Energy states that the amount of energy in a closed system will remain the same.
510,When we tested the hill height our cart weighed 55kg with a 4m drop the PE was 2442 Joules.
107,"For instance, if the potential energy at the top of the hill is 2937, the kinetic energy at the bottom of the hill would be 2930."
174,"E1R: Dear Gonzales Family 
I have come to show you y roller coaster that I think you should build."
580,"That concludes that there is a lot that goes into a roller coaster like how high is your drop, are there loops,are there hills and they can't be taller then the Initial drop or it wont work."
595,"Lastly, I believe that the mass of the roller coaster car should be 60 kg."
584,This means that a system always has the same amount of energy.
360,"In one of my simulations, the total energy was 782 J, but my PE was 0 J and my KE was 781 J."
716,I hope that all of your visitors have a blast at your park with my roller coaster design!
409,Where the ride would start with around 2600J total energy which we have thankfully lowered to ensure more safety to others.
218,If the hill is the same height or higher then the cart doesn't have enough energy to go over the hill without extra support.
368,"When I simulated a 5 meter drop, the PE at the top was 1955 Joules."
814,"For example, when I tested the drop height of 2m, the PE at the top was 977 Joules at the top."
495,"E1: The initial drop height should be 5m, this way we can get a lot of Potential Energy (PE) and Kinetic Energy (KE) to get our ride going and can allow the cart to run on mechanical energy."
756,"In a test I did where the mass of the car was 60 kg, the total energy was 2936 J."
46,We needed to find the best height to provide the greatest amount of energy to be able to insure a fast ride.
190,Finally in my last test i changed the weight of the car.
574,My ride would be better than any ride.
422,"Setting the initial drop height to the highest possible amount (5 meters in the simulation) will allow for the highest amount of KE at the bottom of each drop, which is the applied energy making the coaster move so fast."
277,We do need some things that might help our roller coaster to be fun.
480,You will also need to keep in mind that energy cannot be created or destroyed.
585,"E1: First, I would recommend that the roller coaster car begins at an initial drop height of 5 meters off the ground."
212,Both the PE and KE are measured in J(Joules).
794,PE and KE are indirectly related.
820,"For instance, when my height was set to 2m, the TE was 977, the KE at the bottom was 977, but the PE was 0."
577,I learned that the higher the roller coaster the higher the total energy it will be.
759,E1R: My team and I have come up with a couple ideas for the roller coaster for you and your family's park.
213,"Now for my first example, the initial drop is going to be at 5.0 kg, with the cart being 50 kg, the PE at 2443 J and the KE at 0 J."
676,"At the top of a drop of 5 meters, the car had 2,834 and 0 joules of potential and kinetic energy respectively, while at the bottom, the car had 0 and 2,834 joules of potential and kinetic respectively."
477,When you have more PE you will start at a higher drop and have more total energy than the roller coasters that have a shorter drop.
448,The PE was always less than the initial drop so it can make it over the hill.
641,"At the lowest point after the drop and before the loop, the car will be moving at its fastest speed."
186,When i added the hill i kept the initial drop at 5 meters but i adjusted the hill height.
722,This will help ensure that the coaster doesn't get stuck when it is going up a hill or through a loop.
159,I am going to show you how my roller coaster you should have in you park.
206,"The initial drop is the starting point, the higher it is, then its a better chance at making it to the end."
330,So you can see there will be more speed if your hill is shorter but you also want it to be enjoy able so 3m is a good in between height.
546,"Throughout the ride, the total energy remains the same."
621,but it can be transfused in to KE or PE.
160,My roller coaster has a starting initial drop that no one will suspect.
514,"E1: The roller coaster should have a mass that is at least 60 kilograms) the initial drop at 5 meters, and a hill height of 4 meters to make it more fun."
447,My second test failed as I tested the hill height of 5 meters and it wasn't able to make it up and over the hill.
390,"When the car starts traveling up the hill, the kinetic energy goes back to gravitational potential energy because of the gravity pulling the car back down."
405,"This ride won't only bring many more to the ride, it will bring many to the park."
349,So you can see the total energy of the hill needs to be low enough so it can have speed but high enough to have the Kinetic and Potential energy.
555,If the Te at the start of the ride is 2000 and you need 2100j of Te you won't make it over the hill and you need more energy.
185,I ran a couple more test and then I added a hill.
260,"In our first trial the mass was at 40 kg and the potential energy was at 1956 J, this gave it around the same kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop due to transferring energies."
283,E1R: Dear Gonzales family
600,"However, since there is friction in the real world you would need to adjust the heights of the initial drop and hill to make sure the car would make it to the end of the ride with friction."
446,It got all the way to the end.
339,The reason I said the height of your initial drop should be so tall is so you can get the most energy out of it and it will be more fun to ride.
573,The lower the mass the lower the Energy.
674,"At the bottom of the drop, assuming that's the lowest point of the roller coaster, all of that energy will have been converted into kinetic energy, also the same as the total energy."
659,Let's analyze the physics behind why my roller coaster design will be the best for your park.
713,I really hope you will consider my roller coaster design.
748,"Then at the bottom of the initial drop, it would give a PE of 1 and a KE of 1954."
755,"We were also planning on making the carts 60 kg, since that would give the ride more energy at the at the initial drop and at the bottom of the drop."
839,"When I increased the mass to 60kg, my PE increased to 2933."
188,At the top of the hill the PE was at 1675 and the KE 772 and the total energy was 2447.
557,One example is at 5 meters drop height pe at the top is 2932j and ke is 0j.
685,"This is the Law of Conservation of Energy, and it is fundamental to knowing how roller coasters, or physics in general, work."
668,"Throughout all runs, I had no hills and used a car that had a mass of 58 kilograms."
308,"First, we did the initial drop we learned that potential energy turned into kinetic energy."
471,This shows us how the energy doesn't go away and more energy is not created.
101,It is important to ensure that the hill height is not greater than the hill itself.
302,Energy transformation is when the cart goes from PE to KE and then back to PE.
192,With the weight of 60 kg the PE was 2937at the top.
773,"We found that this happens since there isn't enough KE to make it over the hill since the energy has to be split in between KE and PE, we had to make it 4 m. The Law of Conservation of Energy says that Energy can't be created or destroyed only changed, and that is also the reason we can't make the hill height and the initial drop the same."
689,That leads into my next point…
263,It will have just enough energy to make it to the end of the ride.
776,E1R: The drop height for the roller coaster will be 5 meters.
601,"In an environment with friction, some of the energy will be converted into thermal energy, slowing the car down."
813,"This is because the relationship between height and energy is direct, and when the height of the drop increases the TE increases."
163,"The starting initial drop would be 50 m drop and the PE (potential energy) would be about 20,000."
654,"The roller coaster would be fun because of its unique design, and the car would make it without fail with its high drop height."
532,"E1R: The roller coaster should have a mass that is at least 60 kilograms) the initial drop at 5 meters, and a hill height of 4 meters to make it more fun."
825,This is an example of an inverse relationship.
406,"I think this ride could change the entire future of this Park and changed the entire future of your guys' lives, and many more think a ride like the Godzilla would be one of the best decisions of your life."
369,"Showing that when the height goes up, so does the potential energy."
99,So after testing and putting all out data together we have come up with the best design for your roller coaster.
605,"Since energy can't be created or destroyed, as the car goes down the tracks, energy is converted from PE to KE and back again but the total energy always stays the same."
670,"At the bottom of the drop, the car had 0 joules of potential energy and 1,134 joules of kinetic."
175,I am going to show you how my roller coaster you should have in you park.
255,It made it to the end and the kinetic energy at the top of the hill had been 1173 J.
803,For example if the PE was 100 the KE would be zero.
737,On top of that the total energy will increase with the drop height increasing since total energy and PE have a direct relationship.
705,"Therefore, the coaster car should move at the same speed regardless of mass."
698,"So, it started rolling backwards and the car never made it to the end."
516,One example of this from my data (initial drop height) is at the top of the initial drop (2 meters) the potential energy was 977 J.
432,E1R: My team's roller coaster works so well mostly because of the initial drop height.
632,"Here's how the coaster will go, starting from the initial drop."
219,Mass is also a very important factor in physics.
244,If the hill is the same height or higher then the cart doesn't have enough energy to go over the hill without extra support.
324,"In my data the intial drop of 3m had 1465J of Kinetic energy at the end of the drop, where the 5m intial drop had 2930J of kinetic energy."
418,E1: My team's roller coaster works so well mostly because of the initial drop height.
686,The car of my roller coaster design should have plenty of energy.
233,"Along with the initial drop, there is also an energy called ""Potential energy"", that is going to be your start energy (Also your end!)."
437,Of 2443 Joules compared to my test of 4 meters which had a PE that decreased to 1955 Joules.
199,THANK YOU
566,"My data supports this equation because my roller coaster had 1j of PE at the bottom of the initial drop, it had 2930j of KE at the bottom of the initial drop, and it had 2932 j of total energy at the end."
761,The total energy does not change throughout the ride even while the KE and the PE are changing.
276,So this shows that our hill height needs to be smaller than the initial drop height.
494,The higher the hill height the more potential energy at the top and kinetic energy at the bottom.
355,"When I simulated a 5 meter drop, the PE at the top was 1955 Joules and the KE at the bottom was 1954 Joules."
322,"According to my data when the intial drop was 3m the amount of potential energy there was, was 1466J compared to the 5m intial drop height which was 2932J of potential energy."
707,Each run of this simulation had a drop height of 5 meters and a hill height of 4 meters.
178,Then you flip up right and you go in to a loop heading straight in to a hill and turn right away for a huge initial drop turn mid way and then you reach the end.The cart will way about 70 KG(kilograms) and reach up to speeds about 150 MPH(miles per hour)and yes i picked it to go 1 MPH then Formula Rossa .
183,When nearing the end of the initial drop you flip to the up right position and get to the end of the coaster.
611,The same is with KE At the top it is at zero and at the bottom it has the same amount as the PE had at the top.
393,"In the last experiment I ran, the hill was the same height as the initial drop (5 m) but it was the only one whose coaster car didn't make it over the hill."
520,"The law of conservation of energy also pertains to when you're going down the initial drop, the energy transfers from potential energy (at the top of the initial drop) to kinetic energy (at the bottom of the initial drop) while going down."
530,So one way to control energy is by adding more mass.
311,But my takeaway on how to make the longest roller coaster is having a big first drop that has a lot of potential energy that can be turned into kinetic energy.
809,The law of conservation of PE is 9.8.
702,"Hence, the car will make it to the end of the track without fail."
644,That is because the car still has some kinetic energy left after the drop and not all of the kinetic energy has converted back to potential.
476,This proves that the more mass you have means that you will have more energy.
679,We can see this in data from Add a Hill.
836,So that is why my drop height will be 5m and my hill height will be 3m- since the hill height is less than my drop height.
787,"It needs to be less then the initial drop because if its to high there wont be enough energy to get over the hill, as energy cant be created."
725,We can say this because our data proves that it won't make it up the hill height that is 5 meters tall.
143,When the height of the hill was 3.20 (lower) the car went over the hill.
334,So you can see the coaster car is more likely to go faster if it has a greater mass.
228,"Some may use power-boost energy, and others can just use physics."
699,My roller coaster design's drop height is higher than the highest point along the track after the drop.
43,We believe that this ride will provide satisfaction to its riders while getting them safely to the end of the ride.
242,Now adding a hill to the ride can be a little difficult if measurements are off to some extent.
727,When we move the hill height to 5 meters the cart doesn't make it up the hill.
717,E1: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
801,And some of the changes that happened when the cart went down the initial drop were the PE and the KE almost canceled out another.
158,"E1: Dear Gonzales Family 
I have come to show you y roller coaster that I think you should build."
332,"For example, one of my test was with a car that was 45kg the amount of energy it had at the beginning was 2182J."
630,Let's go into depth with each of those points.
788,When we tested 5.01 meters the cart was not able to go over.
289,I have been doing a lot of research on roller coasters.
543,A car with 60kg has 2937J of energy while a car with 42kg only has 2054J.
549,Please choose my design.
719,For example we started at a drop height of 2 meters and the PE is 977 joules.
300,That affects the ride a lot because if it didn't change in speed that could be really bad and mess everything up.
5,with the KE of 0 joules.
760,"Then at the bottom of the initial drop, it would give a PE of 1 J and a KE of 1954 J."
161,Then there is a hill that you go up at at a 90 degree angle.
562,This is important because for the car to be able to make it to the top of the hill the initial drop has to be higher than the hill height.
675,We can see this in the data we used previously from Initial Drop.
91,Meaning it will be a more thrilling ride.For example in out data we discovered when we kept the initial drop height and hill height the same but changed the mass we got different total energy's.When we gave the cart a mass of 60kg it had 2938j but when we lower'd the mass of the cart to 40 kg it only had 1959j.
40,"E1: Dear Gonzales Family, 

The roller coaster my team has designed provides a safe yet thrilling ride."
280,This will create more energy for this coaster to be more fun and have more inversions.
197,There will be no phone allowed and we will hold them tight for the m in compartments behind the ticket counter.
35,but if you have more mass then there is more friction so it might not ride as smooth.
807,"50kg car mass it equal to 2448J PE, 40kg is equal to 1958J PE meaning more mass more energy."
320,For the mass of you car I recommend about 60kg in weight based on my investigations.
661,"At the top of an initial drop, the car will have all of the energy it will ever have, which starts in the form of potential energy."
524,My evidence of this is in my data.
399,It would be called the Godzilla to kinda reference the name of the park and it would have a room that you enter showing the backstory about Godzilla and how he is today.
576,PE and KE changes when the car moves down the hill is different and depends on the car weight but it does not change that much but it does change.
541,One to get more energy is to make the hill higher.
671,"With an initial drop height of 5 meters, the car had 2,834 joules of potential energy and 0 joules of kinetic, while at the bottom, the car had 0 joules potential and 2,834 kinetic."
201,Roller coasters need some way to get energy to make it to the end of it.
112,"The amount of mass, potential energy, and kinetic energy are interrelated, as they all play a crucial role in assisting the coaster cart to traverse over the hill."
643,We can prove this using data from some of my runs of a simulation.
191,I changed the weight 4 times.
828,"When my car went down the drop, the PE lowered to 0, but the KE rose to 2443."
695,We can see this using more data from Add a Hill.
114,"E1R: Hello Gonzales family,
I have discovered that the most optimal roller coaster design involves an initial drop height of 5.00."
18,the 50kg had 2443. the 60kg had 2932 joules.
225,"E1R: Hello Gonzales family, I will be talking about how our roller coaster design."
52,"So if the initial drop isnt higher than the hill, the coaster wont have the energy it needs to get the car over the hill."
665,"Once the car is at the bottom of the initial drop, all of the potential energy that could be converted is now kinetic energy."
525,"When the hill height was the same as my initial drop height which is 5 meters high, the cart did not go over the hill it just kept going back and fourth."
264,These are the current suggestions I have provided for the roller coaster that is desired.
299,This makes it speed it and slow down.
100,"E1: Hello Gonzales family,
I have discovered that the most optimal roller coaster design involves an initial drop height of 5.00."
463,Another drop point was 2.50m the PE was 1222j at the top and the KE was 1221j at the bottom.
407,"E1R: Dear Gonalzes family,"
345,"I recommend a height of about 3m, you maybe wondering why it can't be higher than the initial car , and we'll it can but then the coaster car can't make it over the hill, not allowing it to finish the track."
631,My roller coaster design has a lot of twists and turns that make the roller coaster more fun than other rides.
624,that when there is more mass there is more energy because it is more heavy.
845,The TE will continue to remain the same as long as the variables are kept consistent during that trial.
375,"When the car starts traveling up the hill, the kinetic energy goes back to potential energy because of the gravity pulling the car back down (this is called gravitational potential energy.)"
282,When the car weighed 40kg it created 1956 joules of energy while the car that weighed 60kg created 2934 joules of energy.
230,Now how does a roller coaster use physics?
732,In our data the PE at the top of the hill is 980j and the KE at the top of the KE is 1463j.
556,One way to get more energy is to make the hill higher.
648,We can see this with another one of my data points.
168,When nearing the end of the initial drop you flip to the up right position and get to the end of the coaster.
746,"Then the PE at the bottom of the initial drop will be around 1 J and the KE at the bottom of the initial drop will be 2,442 J, with a total energy of 2,443 J."
537,"At 5 meters release height, the total energy is 2932, the energy is higher than 4 meters release height which is 2346 total energy."
2,by making it so the height is high you make it so the energy is high too.
796,E1: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
740,The total energy is always the same as the PE at the top of the initial drop.
134,"When the initial drop had a height of 2, the TE was 977 J. when the initial drop had a height of 5, the TE was 2443 J."
288,"E1: Dear, the Gonzales Family"
42,Hills reaching 4.75 m and thrilling speeds.
682,"At the top of a hill with a height of 3 meters, the car had 1,708 joules of potential energy and 847 joules of kinetic energy."
587,"For example, in my trials when I tested an initial drop height of 4 meters, I found that the PE at the top of the drop was 1955 joules and the KE at the bottom was 1954 joules."
623,I tested this zero friction that is not real and cant happen.
507,"E1R: The initial drop height should be 5m, this way we can get a lot of Potential Energy (PE) and Kinetic Energy (KE) to get our ride going and can allow the cart to run on mechanical energy."
152,The kinetic energy is the moving energy in an object.
466,This helped us decide where we should start our roller coaster and where to put the hills.
745,"We want to start with an initial drop height of 5 m. That would create a PE of 2,443 J and a KE of 0 J at the initial drop, and a total energy of 2,443 J."
474,When the weight of the car was 45kg the total energy was 1964j.
333,Where as the amount the car with a mass of 60kg had 2934J of potential energy at the intial drop height.
17,the trial with 40kg had 1955 joules of TE.
434,E1: The initial drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters tall.
789,"At the top of the hill the PE was 2448J, which is greater than the energy given at five meters, making it so the cart coldnot go over the hill."
534,"Like all forms of energy, it is measured in Joules or J."
379,"In comparison to a different trial in the same experiment, I had a hill height of 4.75 m, just 0.25 m from the initial drop height, and the coaster car got over the hill."
237,"The one decreasing is going to be the PE, while the one increasing is going to be KE."
842,"This is because the relationship between height and PE is direct, and when the height of the drop increases the TE increases."
656,E1R: I designed a roller coaster for your theme park that is both physically viable and fun.
830,"When the TE remained as 2443 during the trial for 5m drop, this proves the Law of Conservation of Energy."
677,"While the car is going down the drop, the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy more and more until the bottom of the drop."
335,"As you can see Gonzales, the heights and masses I have provided you are good for everything you are looking for in the roller coaster."
747,"We also did another test where the initial drop was 4 m, giving the PE at the top of the initial drop 1955 J, and a KE of 0 J at the top."
741,The KE is different at the top of the hill.
267,The total energy will always be the same as the potential energy at the top of the drop giving it a higher total energy.
647,"However, if this loop were higher than the initial drop, the car wouldn't make it to the end since all of the kinetic energy would be exhausted and the car would move backwards."
684,"So long as we're working with a closed system, the total energy within that system will remain the same no matter what and energy can only be converted from one form to another."
106,"If a coaster cart with a mass of 60 begins to move downhill, there is a change in both its kinetic and potential energy."
646,This is because the car still had 276 joules of kinetic energy at the top of the hill after the drop.
738,This is because with the initial drop at 5 meters if we make the hill too high the cart won't make it up the hill.
346,According to my trials the hill of 3m had 1768J of potential energy and 582J of kinetic whereas 4.5 had 2276J potential energy but only 73J of kinetic energy.
26,at the bottom its the same the energy just converts to the opposite.
431,"Set your initial drop height very high, make sure your hill height is high but not as high as the initial drop, and ensure your car mass is high."
628,My coaster design will be fun to ride on since it features loops and wraps around the track every now and then.
229,Lets make a roller coaster that uses physics.
383,"The heaviest car had a total of 2938 js while the lightest car had a total of 1959 js, so the heavier the car, the more total energy it will have."
269,"In our first trial the mass was at 40 kg and the potential energy was at 1956 J, this gave it around the same kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop because energies cannot be completely eliminated only transfered."
531,"If you have less mass, you can risk the cart not going fast enough to make it up the hill, and it likely wouldn't be fun or very safe."
569,"When decreased the drop height to 4.15 meters, the PE increased to 2432 joules."
664,Kinetic energy is the energy that is formed when things actually do happen.
472,Since no energy is lost or added you follow the law of Conservation of Energy.
424,The coaster will be unable to get over the hill if the drop and hill heights are the same because it would be putting in the same amount of energy.
193,At the bottom the KE was 3930.
162,Then you flip up right and you go in to a loop heading straight in to a hill and turn right away for a huge initial drop turn mid way and then you reach the end.The cart will way about 70 KG(kilograms) and reach up to speeds about 150 MPH(miles per hour)and yes i picked it to go 1 MPH then Formula Rossa .
515,Potential energy and kinetic energy have an inverse relationship.
146,"When the initial drop had a height of 2, the TE was 977 J. when the initial drop had a height of 5, the TE was 2443 J."
627,E1: I designed a roller coaster that might just be the trick to attract visitors.
453,where the energy goes is in thermal and sound energy among multiple of different types of energy.
297,sorry i didn't finish it completely slipped my mind
636,"Also, using my design for the roller coaster, the car should be able to make it to the end without a problem."
184,When i was researching about KE and PE i found out that a initial drop from 5 meters that the PE at the top was at 2463 and the KE was 0 but when it reached the bottom the PE was at 1 and the KE was at 2462 and the total energy was 2463.
808,E1R: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
25,with the KE of 0 joules.
121,"For instance, if the potential energy at the top of the hill is 2937, the kinetic energy at the bottom of the hill would be 2930."
169,The roller coaster will be about 2 minutes long and i will charge 11 dollars a person.
376,The coaster car doesn't have enough kinetic energy to go up a hill the same size as the initial drop much less one that is bigger.
597,"In my trials, I tested a car mass of 50 and found the PE at the top of the drop was 2446 joules and the KE at the bottom was 2443 joules."
165,When getting near the end of the loop you will go into a hill then right in to a drop.
