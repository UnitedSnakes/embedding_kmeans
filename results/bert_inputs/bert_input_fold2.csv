825,"For example, when I tested the initial drop height of 2 M the amount of PE was 887 J, but when I tested the drop height of 5 M the amount of PE at the top of the initial drop was 2,179 J."
309,"The potential energy was 1 and the kinetic energy was 1172 Joules, so potential energy changed into kinetic energy."
565,"We need total energy because it basically splits itself between 2 energies, kinetic, and potential."
567,"E1: In this letter of recommendation, I will go over why my roller coaster will be fun, the science behind it, and what are the requirements for the roller coaster cart to get to the end."
101,"In my data I found that when the release height was 2 m, the potential energy at the top of the hill was 821 J and the KE at the bottom of the hill was 820 J."
578,My tests concluded that the hill has to be shorter than the initial drop.
250,If the drop height is lower than the hill the coaster car will go backwards.
179,Total energy is always the same as the PE at top of initial drop.
324,"Meanwhile the KE has 0 at the top while 2,442 at the bottom."
380,The higher the PE and KE higher the total energy will be.
786,"The relationship between KE and PE and total energy is that in a fiction-less world, the PE and the top of the initial drop is the total energy, and KE and PE switch off."
384,I believe they should do this because they will have enough KE from the initial drop to get around the hill.
345,"But if you have a ride with 2,400 that ride is going to be exciting.PE and KE can't both be low because they are opposites."
115,So that shows that the more mass the cart is the more energy the roller coaster is gonna have.
722,For example when I tested the drop height of 5 meter the PE was 2443 Joules.
342,"Dear Gonzales family, here is some feedback about roller coasters."
489,You want a lot of momentum since that creates more kinetic energy and it will be harder to slow down so my roller coaster won't stop.
739,E1: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 4 meters.
97,"I learned in my data that when the initial drop was 4 m, and the hill height was 3.25, the roller coaster made it over the hill."
13,This shows to have a exiting ride you want to a heavier cart mass to have a faster and more entertainment for the riders.
460,Why?
88,And be able to make it back to the start safely.
462,"With this design, the car will start at the top with a lot of potential energy."
75,When I had a drop of 5m I had 2424 total energy compared to 977 total energy with a drop of 2m.
701,Which had more energy then the 50kg car and the 40kg car.
470,"This is because the higher the initial drop, the higher the hill height can be and still have the cart get past.This will give more Potential energy, and at the bottom, more Kinetic energy."
244,"At the end of the coaster, there will be no PE and all KE."
407,"E1: Dear Mr. and Ms. Gonzales,"
673,The taller the hill the faster you can go so the initial drop height will matter.
38,E1: The science behind why my current roller coaster design will be exciting and will make it to the end of the ride without stopping.
810,So that is why the drop height should be more than the hill height.
76,This data shows that a higher initial drop gives the roller coaster more total energy.
237,This is because all the KE has not been built up yet.
634,But you may be thinking how can it get back up the starting point if they are at 2 different heights.
718,"To add, when the cart goes up a hill the PE will lower and the KE will get bigger, then it converts into PE, and KE again."
292,PE and KE can only be transformed into each other they can never be created or destroyed.
153,"And, when the mass was 56 kg, the total energy was 2193 J."
503,An object that is not moving has zero kinetic energy.
294,"This basically breaks down to PE = no movement, KE = movement."
217,At the top of the hill the PE is 1995 J and the KE should be at 0 J. Theoretically this means as the coaster car goes down the hill the PE will transfer over to KE making it equal around the middle of the hill.
226,"Finally, the mass has a big play in the speed and energy of the roller coaster for example."
488,The larger the mass the larger the momentum.
691,so that it will have enough energy to make it to the end of the track.
107,"So if the roller coaster wants to have a ton of energy, having a really tall initial drop would be the best way to do that."
589,I know this because in all of the tests I have made the higher the drop is the more total energy is involved with the simulation.
3,"First, you need a height that is higher than the hill so lets put it at 5.00m for the initial height and 3.00m for the hill."
676,"The cart will make it to the end because the amount of energey from the intial drop will be enough to go though the loops and, hill even if friction changing enrgey to thermal energey."
373,"E1: Dear Gonzalez Family,"
400,With a higher mass the more energy it will take for the cart to get over hills and loops.
577,I kept the highest height I experimented with and added hills onto it four different times.
838,"E1R: To have a fun and exciting rollercoaster, a recommendation I would make for the Gonzales family is to have the height of the initial drop be 5 meters, the height of the hill should be 2 meters, and the car mass should be 60 kg."
124,"But, adding the features that will make the roller coaster safe is necessary while building a roller coaster."
658,But as it gets up the hill the kinetic energy then turns into potential I know this throughout the trial initial drop.
638,It would then be the next peoples turn to go
37,I hope you learned what it takes to have a fun usable ride and will choose my design.
446,my third trail's hill height is 2.50 the pe top of initial drop is 1 ke top of initial drop is 1233 and the pe top of hill is 1221 ke top of hill is 2 and the total energy is 1223 and it didnt made it to the end.
241,"Now, we have to add a hill we need to make sure that the coaster car has enough speed to get over the hill."
569,To have more energy the height of the initial drop must be high.
57,"It, affects the ride because it has to be equal to be able to work."
364,"When the car mass was at 40kg with an itial drop height of 5.00 meters, the PE had a sum of 1955J."
111,The mass of the cart effects the KE and PE.
674,"E1: for starters, it has a 400 ft intial drop that is inverted."
140,"In my data, when the initial drop was 4 m, the PE at the top was 1643 J."
494,E1R: My team's roller coaster is the best design with much exciting parts and will make it to the end of the ride without stopping.
491,In conclusion the Gonzales Family should follow my recommendations about my best roller coaster design.
409,Making its drop height high would not only give it time to build velocity but also let you add more loops or hills to the track after the drop.
474,"This can be proven with total energy which is mechanical energy, combined with other energy."
758,"If you have a drop height of 4 meters, and a hill height of 5 meters, it is most likely that your car will not make it up the hill height."
224,If the drop height is lower than the hill the coaster car will go backwards.
763,"For example, in my trial where my mass was 40 kg, the PE was 1565 Joules, and my KE was 1565 Joules too."
90,"But, adding the features that will make the roller coaster safe is necessary while building a roller coaster."
539,You should choose the highest drop height to maximize the enjoyment of the ride and increase speed.
64,The bigger the mass is the more KE you will have at the bottom of the initial drop.
728,The change in PE and KE when going down the hill is when you first go down the hill it is a higher PE.
306,E1R: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
49,"The relation ship between mass, PE and KE is the bigger the mass the more PE you will have at the top of the initial drop."
285,The PE and KE depend on the height of the drop because the more the height is the more the PE will be a the top of the ride and the more the KE will be at the bottom of the ride.
440,That could be at the top of a hill or the bottom of a hill.
7,As the data shows PE at the top of initial drop was at 2446J and the PE and the top of the hill was 1474J creating a lot of KE to follow.
804,When it is friction less almost always the PE will go into KE when it is at the bottom of the ride.
542,"In trial 3 of adding hills, the hill height was 4 meters and the initial drop height was 5 meters."
787,"For example, when the drop height was 3 the PE was 1173 and the total energy was also 1173."
562,The total energy was 2932 joules.
745,"The height of the drop also relates to KE at the bottom, assuming there is no friction, the KE at the bottom will be the same as the PE at the top."
424,This way we can have the most energy possible.
468,"It can become diferent energy like thermal energy, but it will never go away."
120,Adding a hill is a good idea but if the hill is taller then the initial drop height then the roller coaster would not make it over the hill and to the end.
356,"For example when the release height was at 5.00 meters, the potential energy had 2443 Jules."
365,"When the car mass was at 60kg with an initial drop height of 5.00 meters, the PE had a sum of 2933J which was more likely to go up the hill and make it to the end of the coaster."
782,This is because we want more energy and for it to make it over the hills and around the loops.
152,"In my trial, when the car weighed 44 kg, the total energy was 1723 J."
202,"This process continues as the coaster goes through the various hills, drops, and loops of the ride."
52,"The science behind it is my car mass is as high as can be, the initial drop is as high as it can be, the hills are as high as they can be without being the same height or higher than the initial height."
473,"This is because the law of conservation of mas states that energy can't be created, or destroyed."
593,Because if you make the first hill or first loop taller than the initial drop then the roller coaster will roll back down the hill or loop and it will not make it over.
79,I know this because the potential energy and kinetic energy combined always equal the total energy in my data.
840,The PE and KE added up together always equal the TE because the PE chakinetic energy plus thenges into KE during the rollercoaster.
734,E1R: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
368,"When making roller coasters, It needs to be fun and exciting while still making it to the end of the ride."
197,"The ride will start at the top of the hill, where the coaster has the most potential energy."
702,In the real world the out come would be bifferent.
150,The mass of the cart effects the KE and PE.
30,"Lastly, you want to have a heavier cart mass."
161,"This is because you can get the maximum amount of energy from that height, so you will have more speed and velocity."
182,"When the KE and PE dont add up to the same thing as total energy, it doesn't mean that the energy just dissappear, but rather it changed into a unuseful energy such as thermal."
436,I hope you take my ideas into consideration and make the coaster the best it can be.
795,"For example, when the drop height was 3 the PE was 1173 joules and the total energy was also 1173 joules."
116,"So, the more energy the better, so making a cart with more mass would make the roller coaster better."
636,Making it impossible for the roller coaster to make it back up to the starting point.
230,These pieces of evidence prove that mass and energy have a big relationship with PE and KE.
108,The amount of PE at the top of the hill was always more then the KE at the top of the hill in the trials that I did.
688,then goes into a 3m loop.
98,"When the initial drop was 4 m, and the hill height was 5, the roller coaster did not make it over the hill and it didn't make it to the end of the track."
703,"Because, some of you energy would be turned into thermal energy."
686,"In the real world the out come would be bifferent because, some of you energy would be turned into thermal energy."
476,E1: My team's roller coaster is the best design with much exciting parts and will make it to the end of the ride without stopping.
180,"For example, when PE at top of drop was 1759J, if you look across it shows that the total energy was also 1759J."
85,If we give the car more mass the roller coaster will go at a faster and more exciting pace.
298,"E1R: Hey, Mr. Gonzales I've created a roller coaster design for you."
755,"What I saw in my data, was the total energy never went up or down."
453,Then it will be fun and faster roller coaster.
781,E1: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
803,Then when I changed to 5 meters the KE was 2697 Joules.
186,"For example, 50kg at car mass, means it would be about 2446 at initial drop."
302,"For example, when I tested the drop height of 2 meters, the potential energy was 1173 Joules."
682,but it also will take more energrey to get up the hills.
502,KE is a energy that a object has do to its motion the fast the object moves the greater the kinetic energy.
587,"E1R: In this letter of recommendation, I will go over why my roller coaster will be fun, the science behind it, and what are the requirements for the roller coaster cart to get to the end."
339,"But, if you cart weighs 60kg it will have a total energy of 2,937."
779,"This is because the more height, the more stored energy to get to the end."
452,Because the gravity will be pulled faster and the friction will get more energy.
36,This will create the most enjoyable ride for the riders.
414,Also note that the mass of the car will be a factor in the amount of total energy there is.
392,This is because it is stored energy.
555,We had our hill and initial drop height the same as in trial 1.
399,The mass in the car will effect the KE and PE in the roller coaster.
798,E1: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
757,This is all related to the drop height and hill height.
626,The roller coaster will get through the obstacle because it is carrying its same energy as the initial drop height.
290,One example i can give you is if you had a 5 meter initial drop and the hill is 10 meters high the car will not make it to the top of the hill.
398,The Law of Conservation says that energy can't be created or destroyed only converted and energy had not been converted yet because this was at the bottom of the initial drop.
437,E1R: My recommendation is we start out roller coaster's initial drop at the height of 5 meters.
451,The mass will be set to 50kg so it makes it heaveir to fall down the hill faster.
264,"Also, the drop height of my roller coaster design is 4.45 meters this is important because it makes the roller coster fast and goes up the hills and making it fun and not a boring ride."
789,"For example, if the cart is exactly halfway down the hill and the PE was 100 and Ke was 0 at the top."
585,This is because if the cart has more mass it will pick off more speed thus creating more kinetic energy and friction giving off more heat energy.
508,the law of conversation can not be created or destroyed but it can convert from one type of energy to another.
417,"In the end, the choice is yours, but I would recommend that if you want a faster coaster, make the car weigh more, but if you want it to be a little slower, make the cart a bit lighter."
331,Because if they are then the cart can't go over.
666,The same is with kinetic energy at the top it is at zero and at the bottom it has the same amount as the potential energy had at the top.
146,Because the energy will always be the same total energy so having a large amount of energy will make the ride better.
157,Using my data this proves that the higher the initial drop the more energy it has which the more energy the better the roller coaster.
211,This is because all the KE has not been built up yet.
310,"This is because potential energy changes into kinetic energy, and kinetic energy convert into potential energy, and then it repeats in a cycle."
9,"Lastly, you want to have a heavier cart mass."
343,"Roller coasters are fun and exciting because of initial height and hills.This is why, the height of your initial drop relates to your PE at the top and the KE at the bottom."
625,This obstacle is 3(meters) tall at the max point.
455,"This will give more Potential energy, and at the bottom, more Kinetic energy."
611,The total energy is determined by KE and PE when they are at their maximum energy.
447,So the best one would be the second one.
438,The joules that are part of the potential energy are equal to the total energy until the cart starts to move down the hill.
397,The total energy was also 977J.I think this happend because there would be no where for energy to be created or destroyed.
192,"The coaster gains speed and momentum, and as it approaches the bottom of the hill, it reaches its maximum kinetic energy."
299,PE and KE can only be transformed into each other they can never be created or destroyed it is a never ending cycle between each other.
55,This is also because the higher it is the less PE it has on the top and the more KE at the bottom.
53,The height of the initial drop needs to be an high as it can.
102,"When the release height was 4.75 m, the potential energy was 1950 J at the top of the hill and the KE was 1949 J at the bottom of the hil."
654,This proves 2 different ways how the initial height has to be higher than the hill itself.
767,"E1R: My teams roller coaster is striving for an exciting, scary, and safe ride."
92,"Then, it has enough energy to make it over the hill."
14,In conclusion I would recommend higher initial drop than the hill and a heavier cart mass to have the most TE you can have.
276,Lastly your mass shouldn't be huge but not small so right in the middle so the car can do the hills and all the stuff you want it to safely.
694,And hill even if friction changing enrgey to thermal energey.
648,The initial drop height will be higher than all my hills also.
572,One good way to have lots of potential energy is to start high up in the air.
358,"The higher the potential energy, the higher number of Jules for kinetic energy, which is needed to make it to the end of the ride."
774,This data shows that PE and KE transform into each other throughout the roller coaster.
699,that is a differants of 1m giving it plenty of energy to make it over.
836,"When the mass of the car was 40 kg the TE was 1,565 Joules, but when the car mass was 60 kg the TE was 2,348 Joules."
117,"When making the roller coaster, make a cart with more mass and a higher initial drop."
527,"E1: Today, I will be telling you about the best design you can do for your new roller coaster, it will have the most speed, the most exciting, and most importantly, it will be safe."
425,I know this is true because when I tested the initial drop height the first trial was 2 meters and there was only 977 J of energy.
534,"In trial 2 of testing the initial drops, we set the height to 2 meters."
113,"In my trial, when the car weighed 44 kg, the total energy was 1723 J."
29,My data shows that in the initial drop simulator the PE at the bottom was 1 and as you can see it never went down to zero due to that law.
318,"E1: Roller coasters that have an initial drops, and hills make it exciting."
456,"This will make the car go further, and faster giving more flexibility for the hill height.Speaking of hill height, I would say should be about 3 meters."
498,"like how the deigns will function use energy, making it to the end with out stopping, testing hills, and more."
329,The less energy you have the more it is going to be boring.
327,"If you only have 1,000 KE the ride is going to be pretty boring."
423,E1: My recommendation is we start out roller coaster's initial drop at the height of 5 meters.
355,Initial drop is important while making a roller coaster.
188,The relationship between PE and KE is direct because as one changes so does the other.
376,This is the initial drop.
328,"But if you have a ride with 2,400 that ride is going to be exciting."
756,"This is because energy wasn't created during the trial, but it also wasn't destroyed."
295,The total energy can always be known if you know what the PE is because they are the same thing.
12,So when it was at 60kg the total energy was 2932J and when at 40kg the total energy was at 1954J.
796,"For example, if the cart is exactly halfway down the hill and the PE was 100 joules and Ke was 0 joules at the top."
408,My suggestion for your roller coaster would be to make its drop height high.
479,"Since my roller coaster will have lots of speed to it, it will have enough kinetic energy to ride up the next hill."
822,"E1: To have a fun and exciting rollercoaster, a recommendation I would make for the Gonzales family is to have the height of the initial drop be 5 meters, the height of the hill should be 2 meters, and the car mass should be 60 kg."
748,"For example, when I tested the drop height of 4 meters, PE was 1759 Joules, the KE was 1759 Joules at the bottom, and the TE was 1759 Joules."
118,Using my data this proves that the higher the initial drop the more energy it has which the more energy the better the roller coaster.
405,It was 2938J and 40 was 1959 for the total energy.
637,"So we added an elevator, where once the coaster is on top of it and has no more kinetic energy it will pull it back up towards the top until it is at 5(meters) high."
284,"Your energy will stay consistent, the energy changes from potential energy to kinetic energy and then back to potential energy again."
271,"Also, the drop height of my roller coaster design is 4.45 meters this is important because it makes the roller coaster fast and goes up the hills and making it fun and not a boring ride."
381,"With higher energy, it will be more of an interesting ride for riders."
129,The first variable that needs to be included in the roller coasters track/design is the initial drop.
696,And sence force can not be created or destoyed.
708,"The KE amount, and once the cart got to the top of the hill the KE would switch to the PE."
769,The drop height of my roller coaster design is 4 meters.
35,In conclusion I would recommend higher initial drop than the hill and a heavier cart mass to have the most TE you can have.
255,"Evidence from our data will further prove this point in my first trial my car mass was 40kg and the total energy was 1995 J but in my last trial with a coaster car of 60kg, the total energy is 2933."
805,"For example the PE at the top of the drop was 2697Joules, then the KE was 2697 Joules at the bottom of the drop."
246,we can look at our data and find that in the middle of the initial drop of 5.00m that the PE is transferring to KE and still equaling the total energy of 1955 J.
359,"When making the roller coaster, hills play a big roll too."
209,The initial drop on my roller coaster is 5.00m this is because it had the highest PE and KE in joules while still being safe for the hill and loop.
104,"The relationship between KE, PE, and total energy, effect the ride because when the ride has more energy the higher the initial drop is."
481,My roller coaster cart changes quickly along the tracks.
128,And more total energy will make the roller coaster better.
477,"The Gonzales family should love my ride because it contains much thrill, high drops, and very powerful."
95,The first variable that needs to be included in the roller coasters track/design is the initial drop.
505,PE is stored energy.
454,E1: The drop height of my rollercoaster will be 5 meters.
259,E1: during my proposal to the Gonzales family.
18,The roller coaster will be exciting and make it to the end without stopping.
575,The only problem is that one drop isn't going to make a fun roller coaster you still need to add some hills to it.
545,This trial did not have enough energy to make it up and was stuck going right up to the top and falling back down never stopping.
122,And be able to make it back to the start safely.
712,For the cart to stop the PE needed to stop and there needed to be no KE.
160,E1: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
612,So when the potential energy is at its fullest and when the kinetic energy is at its fullest that is total energy.
645,I know this because in the mass vs energy simulation when the car was 60 kg it had a total of around 2900(J) of total energy.
40,The height of the initial drop needs to be an high as it can.
0,E1: Recommendations for the Gonzales family about your best roller coaster design.
834,"When I tested the hill height at 2 meters and the initial drop height at 5 meters, there was more TE than when the hill height was greater."
346,PE is energy stored in non -moving objects.
549,"Lastly, you must consider the weight of the coaster, this is essential to the amount of total energy you want in your coaster."
529,"For your initial drop, you are going to want to make the highest coaster you can, you want to do this because it will have the most total energy and will have the most speed off of the initial drop."
660,The roller coaster will get through any obstacle as long as long as it is carrying its same energy as the initial drop height if the hills are smaller than the initial drop height.
441,It doesn't matter at what point the cart is at all the energy will add up to total energy.
28,"That means that the energy never goes away, there is always energy."
86,I know this because when I had a mass of 60 kg my car had a total energy of 2934 compared to when my car had a total energy of 40 kg and the car had a total energy of 1956
159,Adding a hill is a good idea but if the hill is taller then the initial drop height then the roller coaster would not make it over the hill and to the end.
602,Because it is lighter so it will not slow down as easy as the heavier one will.
319,"This is why, the height of your initial drop relates to your PE at the top and the KE at the bottom."
123,Adding a whole bunch of hill and loops will make the roller coaster super fun and exciting.
251,If the hill is too low compared to our initial drop it could cause injuries to passengers aboard.
378,I know this because when I tried it with a drop height of 5m the PE was 2444J.
390,"E1R: Dear Gonzalez Family,"
22,Using the data I have collected from Initial drop when it was at 5.00m there was a lot more PE and KE resulting in more TE all together because PE+KE+TE making is a better ride for riders to enjoy.
418,"Most importantly, make sure you make the drop height high and never make the hills taller than the initial drop height."
514,Because the wight of the car weighs it down to go faster.
196,E1R: My recommendation is to have the roller coaster weigh 60kg and for the initial drop to be 5m.
497,E1: the past few days I have been doing lots of test notes and data to find the best roller coaster that live up to expectation.
448,E1R: Some recommendations that I think will be helpful for the Gonzales family is my huge roller coaster thats exciting and fast my reasoning comes from my data that I pulled from the roller coasters.
761,"Lastly, mass, PE, and KE are all related."
571,I know this because to have more total energy you have to have the chance for kinetic energy.
541,"The hill requires a certain amount of energy and for the coaster, we are making we will not have enough energy to make it up a higher hill without support from other forces."
60,The energy transformation is how the energy changes when it goes down a hill or if it is going straight.
361,"For example when my hill height was at 5.00 meters with my initial drop at 2.50 meters, the coaster wasn't able to make it up the hill because there wasn't enough potential energy."
270,The total energy will stay the same throughout the ride when there is no friction.
844,"However, as the car starts moving, the PE (energy at rest) changes into KE since the car is in motion."
707,During the start of the cart the PE was 1955 and when it began to go down the hill the PE amount would switch.
149,"At the initial drop in my trial when the drop was 4 m, the potential energy was 1642 J, at the bottom of the hill it all converted over to KE minus 1 J."
759,"This is because the initial drop height's stored energy, is all the energy there is."
662,Another thing to think about is when all potential energy shifts toward kinetic energy to try and make its way up the hill.
458,this is because there will be enouch for the car to go past the hill no matter the friction.
683,like in the experament the car the was 60 kg had more energy then the 50kg car and the 40kg car.
820,That is because there is no PE.
753,"The change in the KE, and PE, along with TE, all relate the Law of Conservation of Energy."
760,"If you have a hill height that supports more energy than there is, then there won't be enough energy to make it up the hill."
640,"E1R: Dear Gonzales Family: I will go over why my roller coaster will be super fun, the science behind how it will work, and how it will get from start to finish."
554,"When we ran our 4th trial, we had set the car to 60 kilograms."
204,Although if there is friction the total energy will transfer into thermal energy throughout the ride.
170,"Between the drop height and hill height, the PE and KE are split at the top of the hill, but at the top of initial drop the PE is a thousand number, and KE is always 0 because it isnt moving."
680,and the drop hight is 400 ft compared to the loop that is 300 ft. that is a differants of 100ft giving it plenty of energy to make it over.
731,So the drop height will give more energy to go over hills.
256,These pieces of evidence prove that mass and energy have a big relationship with PE and KE.
823,"It would be best for the initial drop to be 5 meters because the more height you have, the more TE there will be."
594,"If the hill or loop is smaller though, then it will make it over the hill or loop."
832,"This is because energy can't be created nor destroyed and if the hill height is greater than the initial drop height, energy can't be created so the car won't be able to make it over the hill."
775,If you have a hill height that supports more energy than
194,"This process continues as the coaster goes through the various hills, drops, and loops of the ride."
193,"As the coaster begins to slow down, it climbs the next hill, and the potential energy increases."
684,but also the 50kg car had more energy then the 40kg car.
23,"Secondly, using the data I have collected from adding hills simulation when the initial height was at 5.00m and the hill height was at 3.00m there was the most TE making it a faster ride."
235,The initial drop on my roller coaster is 5.00m this is because it had the highest PE and KE in joules while still being safe for the hill and loop.
693,"Because the amount of energey,, from the intial drop will be enough to go though the loops."
15,This will create the most enjoyable ride for the riders.
32,As it shows in my data from mass & energy when the mass of the cart was at 60kg rather than 40kg.
598,Because energy cannot be created or destroyed.
232,Thank You sincerely ______________
552,The total energy was
478,According to data from my simulations my initial drop height is 5 m. My roller coaster is way more exciting than others because it creates lots more speed from how high the initial drop is.
340,That is all you have to know about roller coaster to make a good design.
723,When I decreased the drop height to 4 meters the PE decreased to 1955 Joules.
374,"During the Roller coaster and energy analysis, we learned about PE and KE at the top of and throughout roller coasters."
210,If the coaster car is at the top of the hill the PE will be 1955 J and the KE at the top of the hill will be 0 J.
173,"If the car mass was 60 then the PE would be about 2936, which shows that the more mass a car has the more PE and KE it has."
546,When going up a hill you can feel the coaster slowing down.
395,The car changes because when the car goes down the initial drop PE and KE stays the same.
156,"When making the roller coaster, make a cart with more mass and a higher initial drop."
595,When the car is at the top of the initial drop then it has the most PE it will ever have.
236,If the coaster car is at the top of the hill the PE will be 1955 J and the KE at the top of the hill will be 0 J.
80,When the kinetic energy was 1 and the potential energy was 2423 the total energy was 2424.
533,It started as potential energy and once the car got moving it quickly became kinetic energy that moved the fastest out of all trials.
312,"The total energy was always the same as the PE, for example, the initial drop was 2 meters, PE was 1173 Joules, and the total energy was 1173 Joules."
383,Gonzalez family should make a hill height of around 4.51m.
21,This way the cart will be able to make it over safety and create an exciting experience for the riders.
480,As a result of having lot's of kinetic and potential energy this will make my roller coaster have more thrill and excitement to my ride.
353,"E1: When making roller coasters, It needs to be fun and exciting while still making it to the end of the ride."
490,So I believe that 56 kg is the best car mass for my roller coaster which makes my roller coaster safe and fun.
807,When the Law of conservation of energy can get created or destroyed that is why the PE goes into KE when the cart is moving down.
262,It represents the overall energy content of the system at any given point during the ride.
510,on the roller coaster I design it starts up high in the air and the PE is very high do to the initial drop high.
744,"When I increased the drop height to 3 meters, the PE increased to 1319 Joules."
445,Now my second trail's hill height is 2.50 pe top of initial drop is 42 and the ke top of initial drop is 2401 pe top of hill is 1214 and ke top of hill is 1228 the total energy is 2443 and it did made it to the end.
131,"I learned in my data that when the initial drop was 4 m, and the hill height was 3.25, the roller coaster made it over the hill."
248,"After, we must concur that our hill and drop height rely on each other."
412,"The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy can't be created or destroyed, so the potential energy becomes kinetic energy."
582,This proves that you have to have a smaller hill than the initial height of your coaster if you want the cart to get to the end.
843,"To support this, at the top of the initial drop the KE is always 0 because KE is energy in motion and at the top of the initial drop the car is not in motion."
726,PE and TE may change depending on the KE.
647,I know the more (J) you have the faster the coaster is gonna go.
6,"Secondly, using the data I have collected from adding hills simulation when the initial height was at 5.00m and the hill height was at 3.00m there was the most TE making it a faster ride."
59,for example the PE at the top was 2443 and at the bottom the PE was 0.
725,But when the initial drop was higher the energy went up.
619,How will this work you may ask.
773,We can conclude then that PE and KE equal TE.
20,"First, you need a height that is higher than the hill so let's put it at 5.00m for the initial height and 3.00m for the hill."
63,"The relation ship between mass, PE and KE is the bigger the mass the more PE you will have at the top of the initial drop."
815,E1R: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
770,"This is because, the more height, the more energy."
4,This way the cart will be able to make it over safety and create a exiting experience for the riders.
764,"But in my trial where my mass was 50 kg, the PE was 1956 Joules, and my KE was 1956 Joules too."
550,"When we were running our trial on the mass of the coaster car, we had our hill height at 4 meters and our drop height at 5 meters."
434,We don't want the cart too heavy because of friction it wouldn't make it over some of the hills that a cart with less mass would.
388,"In the end, PE and KE can't be created or destroyed."
573,This causes the cart to have lots of potential energy because as the cart goes down the drop the kinetic energy will build up.
391,We also learned about initial drop and the relation between KE and PE.
487,My data from my simulations prove that the best car mass is 56 kg.
316,It means that it doesn't matter if it's KE or PE the total energy will always be the same.
33,So when it was at 60kg the total energy was 2932J and when at 40kg the total energy was at 1954J.
771,"For example, when I tested the drop height of 4 meters, PE was 1759 Joules at the top, and the KE was 1759 Joules at the bottom, and the TE was 1759 Joules."
363,The mass of the coaster is important too.
65,"E1: Dear Gonzales family, I have found out how to make the best roller coaster."
321,So the amount of energy from the top of the roller coaster is how much energy you have.
46,The energy transformation is how the energy changes when it goes down a hill or if it si going straight.
215,"Now, we have to add a hill we need to make sure that the coaster car has enough speed to get over the hill."
330,"Hills are tricky, The hill and the initial drop can't be the same."
809,For example if the drop height is 5 and the hill height is 5 then the KE will not have any energy to get up the hill.
239,"Then, we would have to calculate the relationship between PE, KE, and total energy we can figure this out by looking at this example from our data If the initial drop is 5.00m high the PE at the top of the hill would be 1995 J and the KE would be 0 J 1995 plus 0 equals 1995 which would be the total energy."
713,For me and my group we decided that the best way we could transfer energy and store more was to make small hills that the cart could speed through and end with the most amount of KE.
599,The more mass the car has the harder it is going to be going up a hill.
269,This means you cannot create or get rid of energy.
716,"For example, our biggest car mass was 60 and our PE ended as 2936, and the KE at the bottom of the drop was 2930."
521,I call my ride deklan.
813,Then the KE on the top of the initial drop is 2453 and the KE at the bottom of the drop is 2453.
724,The energy when the initial drop was smaller went down a lot.
94,And more total energy will make the roller coaster better.
513,But the 40kg cart only had 1567 total energy.
231,I hope this detailed info page about my coaster proved to you that my roller coaster will be the best and safest option for your guests.
766,"This is an example of a direct relationship between mass, PE, and KE."
223,If the initial drop height is 5.00 the hill height cannot be the same or love it or it will not be able to get over but where we still have enough energy to get over the loop after the hill.
422,"For example, a car that weighs 60 kilograms would have more potential energy than a car that weighs 45 kilograms."
265,E1R: during my proposal to the Gonzales family.
817,"I notice when the roller coaster is at the top of the hill, at a complete stop the total energy is the PE."
492,"My best roller coaster design should conclude an initial drop height of 5 m, hill height 4 m, and best car mass as 56 kg."
772,"Furthermore, PE and KE going down the drop won't be equal, but TE will."
208,"First, we need to make sure we have a safe initial drop."
523,E1R: the past few days I have been doing lots of test notes and data to find the best roller coaster that live up to expectation.
561,"When we were testing and experimenting with the best roller coaster, we noticed that when the initial drop was lower, the amount of Joules was severely slower than that of a higher drop."
317,The relation between the initial drop and hill height is the cars gain energy when going down the drops.
531,"In trial 1, the drop was 5 meters."
687,"E1R: for starters, it has a 4m intial drop that is inverted."
145,"So if the roller coaster wants to have a ton of energy, having a really tall initial drop would be the best way to do that."
622,At the top of the first loop it will be a height of 4 (meters).
103,"So that shows that the relationship between release height and PE is when the release height is higher, the total energy is higher."
685,This is without frction.
812,For example if you have 50 kg on the cart.
163,If you have a higher initial drop the KE will increase the more meters you have on initial drop.
618,"My idea is that we start off the coaster really high up and have 3 loopy- loops, that will have the rider facing the ground three different times and then add a hill at the end that the roller coaster will overcome."
650,At the top of the first hill the height will have to be less than my initial drop.
794,"For example, when I tested the drop height of 3 meters, the PE was 1173 joules."
289,"It can make it to where the car will finish the ride, if you don't the ride won't make it to the end and won't have any excitement or shock to it."
704,E1: The drop height of 5 worked best for me because it created the most PE and was the easiest to get over the hills.
558,"This is why you should have the highest drop height, a hill just a little less than the drop height, and the biggest car you have."
544,"However, when running trial 4, the hill height was 5 meters and the initial drop was also 5 meters."
643,I know all of this information from the trials results I will be showing you and
11,As it shows in my data from mass & energy when the mass of the cart was at 60kg rather than 40kg.
601,If the car is lighter the easier it is going to be to get it to go up the hill or loop.
44,It affects the ride because it has to be equal to be able to work.
190,"The ride will start at the top of the hill, where the coaster has the most potential energy."
351,"But, if your cart weighs 60kg it will have a total energy of 2,937."
416,This is because of gravity and the velocity the heavier car gains.
811,"The relationship between mass, Pe and KE is very intrestiong."
833,"When I tested the hill height at 5 meters and the initial drop height also at 5 meters, the car wasn't able to make it over the hill because energy can't be created nor destroyed."
496,On my roller coaster energy changes from potential to kinetic energy and back again many times.
84,my data showed that if the starting height is 5m and the hill height is 5m the car will not go over the hill compared to when the starting height is 5m and the hill height is 4m and the car goes over the hill.
154,So that shows that the more mass the cart is the more energy the roller coaster is gonna have.
559,"E1R: Today, I will be telling you about the best design you can do for your new roller coaster, it will have the most speed, the most exciting, and most importantly, it will be safe."
574,"I know this is the case because, in my tests for my initial drops, I made the release height 4.07 m and the potential energy at the top of the drop 1987 J, and in a different test I made the height 3.6 m and the potential energy was 1759 J."
563,"We need this for our coaster because when we use hills, the potential energy will increase and be stored for the drop after the hill where it will increase speed again."
362,Then when the hill height was at 2.00 meters the coaster was able to make it up the hill and to the end of the ride because the initial drop was higher up than the hill and had more potential energy.
709,By the end of the ride the KE was at 0 and my PE was at 1955 the total energy at the end of the ride was also 1955.
406,"In the end, PE and KE can't be created or destroyed only converted into new forms."
206,The relation between the initial drop height and hill height in the roller coaster is determined by the speed of the roller coaster and the laws of physics.
366,These are things you need to look for if you want a roller coaster design that will be exciting and make it to the end of the ride without stopping.
733,"PE and KE are both types of energy, mass gives the KE and PE energy to go faster or slower."
485,On my roller coaster energy changes from potential to kinetic energy and back again.
747,"Adding on to this, PE, KE, and TE are all related."
47,The law of conservation of energy is how much energy you need to go around the entire roller coaster without using your own energy.
174,E1R: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
420,"For example, a track that drops from 5 meters would have a higher potential energy than a track that drops from 4 meters."
274,E1: My recommendation for the roller coaster would be that for the initial drop to be at the tallest it can to get a good momentum to keep your ride going.
475,The total energy never changes at all throuout the rollercoaster.
564,"The hill requires a certain amount of total energy and for the coaster, we are making we will not have enough energy to make it up a higher hill without support from other forces."
200,"The coaster gains speed and momentum, and as it approaches the bottom of the hill, it reaches its maximum kinetic energy."
778,"First, based off of the drop height and hill height, the initial drop of my roller coaster will be 4 meters, and the hill height will be 2 meters."
827,At the top of the initial drop the KE is always 0 because KE is energy in motion and at the top of the initial drop the car is not in motion.
557,"This happened because gravity as I previously mentioned, is always pulling down, when it gets the car to go down it will at faster speeds than lighter cars."
750,"Furthermore, PE and KE going down the drop won't be equal, but they do always add up to the total energy."
201,"As the coaster begins to slow down, it climbs the next hill, and the potential energy increases."
705,"For example when my drop height was at 5, my PE was 1955 at the start of the drop."
472,There will be enough kinetic energy for the car to go through the hill at this height.I would also reccomend more mass.
444,My first test is the release height the number is 3.49m then the pe at top of initial drop and the number is 0 the ke top of inital drop is 2437 then the pe top of hill is 1706 ke top of hill is 741 my total energy is 2447 and it did made it to the end.
624,Next comes the second loopy-loop.
168,"When the KE and PE dont add up to the same thing as total energy, it doesnt mean that the energy just dissappear, but rather it changed into a unuseful energy such as thermal."
714,"For example our smallest hill was 2 m and our KE at the top of the hill was 1462, but when our highest hill that was 5 m the KE at the top of the hill was only 602."
133,"So when building the roller coaster, the initial drop height has to be higher then the hill height in the track otherwise the roller coaster will not be making it through safely."
195,The relation between the initial drop height and hill height in the roller coaster is determined by the speed of the roller coaster and the laws of physics.
332,There isn't enough energy to go over the hill if they are the same height.
528,The following writing is the best roller coaster to make.
600,Because the more mass something has the heavier it is going to be because it weights more so it will not have enough speed to make it over the loop or hill because of gravity.
135,"In my data I found that when the release height was 2 m, the potential energy at the top of the hill was 821 J and the KE at the bottom of the hill was 820 J."
499,I have been test out how the weight of the car effects the ride.
443,My data from my first roller coaster.
382,With more PE it will give the cart more energy to get over hills or loops.
401,We want a lower mass because I believe it will make the ride more fun.
352,In conclusion the Gonzales family should really think of all of the facts that go into a roller coaster.
535,"This severely impacted the amount of energy the coaster had, at a measly1173 joules of energy, a whole 1000 less than the 5-meter height, a higher height will have more kinetic energy at the bottom and more at the top."
166,"For example, when PE at top of drop was 1759J, if you look across it shows that the total energy was also 1759J."
252,"Finally, the mass has a big play in the speed and energy of the roller coaster for example."
282,Also your mass shouldn't be huge but not small so right in the middle so the car can do the hills and all the stuff you want it to safely.
580,If you were to add a hill higher than the drop the cart wouldn't be able to get to the end because the cart wouldn't have enough kinetic energy.
442,E1: Some recommendations that I think will be helpful for the Gonzales family is my huge roller coaster thats exciting and fast my reasoning comes from my data that I pulled from the roller coasters.
341,E1R:
553,"1958 joules of energy, this would impact the speed because gravity is always pulling down, gravity will act faster if the car is heavier, this trial was the slowest out of all of them."
664,"In the end Science and the Law Of Conservation proves that his roller coaster will be fully functional if he listens to the science behind it, and follows through what I said."
646,While when the mass was 50 kg it had around 2400(J).
706,But when my release height was only at 2 the PE at the top of initial drop was only 782 and was harder to get up hills and make it to the end successfully.
818,That is because there is no KE.
746,"Back when I tested the drop height of 2 meters, the PE was 883 Joules at the drop, and the KE was 883 Joules at the bottom of the drop."
620,"It is easier than you might think, the coaster cart will be a total of 60 kg so it will have more energy."
172,"For example, 50kg at car mass, means it would be about 2446 at initial drop."
538,"It shifts from one to the other, kinetic energy is the speed and motion part of energy determining how fast the coaster goes."
802,Then the KE was from 2165 Joules with 4 meters.
656,Although kinetic energy and potential energy will go up and down throughout the run.
313,"3 meters, PE 1759 Joules, and total energy 1759 Joules."
464,The car will then use this Kinetic energy to move up the hill.
73,To have the most energy you need to have a higher initial drop.
307,"Additionally, on my roller coaster design when the height of the drop was 2 meters, the potential energy was 1173 Joules."
177,If you have a higher initial drop the KE will increase the more meters you have on initial drop.
765,"This shows that if the mass is greater, then the PE, and KE are also greater."
697,with the energy moving from pe to ke.
257,I hope this detailed info page about my coaster proved to you that my roller coaster will be the best and safest option for your guests.
768,"But in order to accomplish that, we need to explain to you the science behind our roller coaster."
581,I know this because in my research I played around with four different hills and I came across only one cart that didn't make it over and the height of the hill was 4.07 m other than this hill the cart made it over all of the shorter hills.
630,The roller coaster will have no problem going through this considering the Law Of Conservation will be in play.
138,"The relationship between KE, PE, and total energy, effect the ride because when the ride has more energy the higher the initial drop is."
639,In the end Science and the Law Of Conservation proves that my roller coaster will be fully functional and everyone will have a blast going on it.
519,Then there is three more little loops and when thats over you rap around to the bottom and that will be the end of the ride.
816,"The relationship between mass, PE and KE is very interesting."
402,I know this because I had a cart with a mass of 40 and the PE at the top of initial drop was 1959 and KE of 1869.
367,"E1R: Dear the Gonzales family,"
66,To have the most energy you need to have a higher initial drop.
584,I know this because in my testing I kept the same initial drop height and the hill height of 3.05 m and changed the weight of the cart four times and figured out that the more mass the cart has the more total energy there will be on the coaster.
659,In this simulation it shows little to no potential energy at the bottom and the kinetic energy being about the same as total energy.
155,"So, the more energy the better, so making a cart with more mass would make the roller coaster better."
247,This statement proves that the law of conservation of energy is backed up by evidence from research.
668,"When the energy is being transfer the energy cant be crates or destroy, but it an be transfer in to kinetic energy or potential energy."
732,Mass is how much something weighs.
698,and the drop hight is 4m compared to the loop that is 3m.
692,The cart will make it to the end.
501,one big thing i studied was the energy involved using kinetic energy (KE).
430,My next recommendation is we have a hill height of 3.5 meters.
617,E1: Dear Gonzales Family: I have informed you that your new roller coaster is going to be built in such a manner that it will for sure function correctly without friction.
207,"E1: In this essay, I will be providing you, the Gonzolas family with information on why you should add my roller coaster to your theme park."
234,"First, we need to make sure we have a safe initial drop."
326,The more the energy you have at the start the better.
419,"E1R: Dear Mr. and Ms. Gonzales,"
679,And sence force can not be made or destoyed the cart will make it to the end.
225,If the hill is too low compared to our initial drop it could cause injuries to passengers aboard.
435,When we ran our trial with mass the 60 kg cart had the most energy but if we want a coaster that will have hills we should go a little lighter so 50 kg should be the best weight for the coaster.
187,"If the car mass was 60 then the PE would be about 2936, which shows that the more mass a car has the more PE and KE it has."
548,"This car had the exact same amount of energy and was not able to make it through the ride, this is why you need to make a hill smaller than the initial drop height."
752,"We can conclude from the previous sentence that PE and KE change going down the drop, but always add up to equal the total energy."
273,This will make it fun and make it to the end.
482,"When it's cart is at the bottom of the hill, it's moving it fastest."
357,"And when the release height was at 2.50 meters, the potential energy had 1222 Jules."
325,"You also have the relationship between PE,KE and total energy and how it affects the ride."
700,like in the experament the car the was 60 kg.
158,Having a cart that weighs more also provides more total energy.
164,"The more PE you have, the less KE you have at the bottom of initial drop."
590,Another way to add more speed and thus add more total energy would be to make them as heavy as possible.
385,The car changes because when the car goes downhill PE and KE stays the same.
504,then another energy is potential energy (PE).
515,Then strait away that is very fast.
315,"This means that the initial drop with the hill can be at 4 meters, and the PE at the top of the drop is 2931 Joules."
800,"For example when I tested the drop height of 4 meters, the PE was 2165 Joules."
695,"So the Pe at the top will tranfer to enough ke at the bottom, to make it though the loop and hills."
629,This loop has a height of 2 (meters).
471,this is because there will be enough for the car to go past the hill no matter the friction.
672,Energy changes from one form of energy into another form of energy.
829,The TE will always be the same as the PE at the top of the initial drop unless there is friction.
776,"there is, then there won't be enough energy to make it up the hill."
717,E1R: The drop height of 5 worked best for me because it created the most PE and was the easiest to get over the hills.
119,Having a cart that weighs more also provides more total energy.
336,There is also mass.
220,we can look at our data and find that in the middle of the initial drop of 5.00m that the PE is transferring to KE and still equaling the total energy of 1955 J.
43,"The relationship between PE, KE, and total energy is PE+KE=TE."
233,"E1R: In this essay, I will be providing you, the Gonzolas family with information on why you should add my roller coaster to your theme park."
720,E1: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
710,Because there no longer was any KE so the total amount was the amount of PE.
793,E1R: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
132,"When the initial drop was 4 m, and the hill height was 5, the roller coaster did not make it over the hill and it didn't make it to the end of the track."
333,For example if the initial drop is 5m and the Hill height is 5m.
615,That will effect the energy of the car so it will crash into the end.
799,This is because we want are cart to go fast so we put the height up 5 meters.
287,I can explain to you why I created it like this and my thought process of why I did it like this.
525,And the PE is very high do to the initial drop high.
532,The total energy was 2932.
711,When the cart was going through energy transformation the cart would not stop if energy transformation continuted to happen and would never actually stop.
305,"The potential energy was 1 and kinetic energy was 1172, so potential energy changed into kinetic energy, this is because potential energy changes into kinetic energy, and kinetic energy convert into potential energy, and then it repeats in a cycle."
5,Using the data I have collected from Initial drop when it was at 5.00m there was a lot more PE and KE resulting in more TE all together making is a better ride for riders to enjoy.
751,"For example, if the total energy was 200, and the PE was 150 going down the drop, and KE was 50."
136,"When the release height was 4.75 m, the potential energy was 1950 J at the top of the hill and the KE was 1949 J at the bottom of the hill."
543,"The car was safely able to make it over the track in the first run with more than enough energy, at a total of 2937 joules."
667,The changes to kinetic energy on the way down it is half way the have the same amount.
61,The law of conservation of energy is how much energy you need to go around the entire roller coaster without using your own energy.
39,"The science behind it is my car mass is as high as can be, the initial drop is as high as it can be, the hills are as high as they can be without being the same height or higher than the initial height."
277,"The greater amount of height there was more total energy released in the end, But with friction the total amount of energy would go down."
184,"Between the drop height and hill height, the PE and KE are split at the top of the hill, but at the top of initial drop the PE is a higher number and KE is always 0 because it isnt moving."
34,This shows to have an exciting ride you want a heavier cart mass to have faster and more entertainment for the riders.
777,My teams roller coaster design will be very exciting in many different ways.
323,"So at the top you may have 2,443 PE but then at the bottom of the hill you only have 1 PE."
649,This will follow up with a turn turning all the potential energy into kinetic once it goes down the initial drop.
506,in a object do to its position its is gravitational measures is Jules depends on mass.
396,"I know it stays the same because in my data it says, 977J for PE and 0J for KE."
556,This change in weight made the car go much faster and had the most total energy at 2934 joules.
524,on the roller coaster I design it starts up high in the air at 5.0 i found this hight the best because of its height adds to the speed and energy.
661,"The Law Of Conservation it states energy cannot be created nor destroyed, meaning it would have the same amount of total energy, however there will be a mix of both potential energy and kinetic energy."
189,E1: My recommendation is to have the roller coaster weigh 60kg and for the initial drop to be 5m.
87,"E1: On the roller coaster that the Gonzales family decides to make, there needs to be multiple things that are there to make the roller coaster run smoothly."
628,Then comes the third loop.
175,"This is because you can get the maximum amount of energy from that height, so you will have more speed and velocity."
819,But when I am a the bottom of the hill the total energy is the same as the KE.
689,"And and 2m hill after that then going under the ground, and then stoping on a flat serface."
89,Adding a whole bunch of hill and loops will make the roller coaster super fun and exciting.
17,E1R: Recommendations for the Gonzales family about your best roller coaster design.
213,"Then, we would have to calculate the relationship between PE, KE, and total energy we can figure this out by looking at this example from our data If the initial drop is 5.00m high the PE at the top of the hill would be 1995 J and the KE would be 0 J 1995 plus 0 equals 1995 which would be the total energy."
51,E1R: The science behind why my current roller coaster design will be exciting and will make it to the end of the ride without stopping.
653,But then when the hill was 3 meters tall it went over.
507,the last energy we used is law of conservation.
258,Thank You sincerely _____________
303,"When I increased the drop height to 3 meters, the potential energy increased to 1759 Joules."
72,"E1R: Dear Gonzales family, I have found out how to make the best roller coaster."
457,This is a height that we can be sure the car will go through.
403,I also tried it with a higher mass with 60g and it was 2938 for PE and KE was 2908.
348,It won't make it over it will just go back and forth and go nowhere.Meanwhile if you had an initial drop that was 5m while the hill height was 4m it can make it over.
616,So we need the just right mass for the car so it can slow down in time to not crash into the end.
605,And as it goes up the more PE it will have.
841,The relationship between KE and PE is that the PE at the top of a hill is always equal to the KE at the bottom of the hill when there is no friction.
370,For example when the coaster was going down the initial drop it was losing its potential energy and being converted into kinetic energy.
280,"E1R: My recommendation for your roller coaster, would be that for the initial drop to be at the tallest it can to get a good momentum to keep your ride going."
222,"After, we must concur that our hill and drop height rely on each other."
729,But as soon as go down the hill the PE gets lower and the KE goes down one from one from the PE.
536,"Potential energy is the energy pent up inside mass, ready to be put in motion, that is kinetic energy."
633,"to get back to the start line this hill curves very hard to the left making the roller coaster go up the hill at a slower pace, but still making it to the top of the hill."
147,The amount of PE at the top of the hill was always more then the KE at the top of the hill in the trials that I did.
741,"The more height, the more energy."
522,hope you like it.
1,The roller coaster will be exciting and make it to the end without stopping.
785,"When I increased the drop height to 5 meters, the PE increased and was 1995 joules."
737,Total energy is what.
114,"And, when the mass was 56 kg, the total energy was 2193 J."
286,"E1: Hey, Mr. Gonzales I've created a roller coaster design for you."
42,This is also because the higher it is the less PE it has on the top and the more KE at the bottom.
675,"then goes into a 300 ft loop and and 200 ft hill after that then going under the ground, and then stoping on a flat serface."
566,"This will increase the speed with the more total energy you have going down, and losing speed in potential energy."
604,"For instance at initial drop height: 2 the PE is 977, but at 3 it is 1466."
493,This will cause much excitement and thrill to many people and it will make it to the end of the ride without stopping.
125,"So on the roller coaster the Gonzales family builds, add a hill that is very very close to the initial drop height but just a little bit shorter."
459,There will be enough kinetic energy for the car to go through the hill at this height.I would also reccoment more mass.
740,This is because the energy is dependent on the height.
469,E1R: The drop height of my rollercoaster will be 5 meters.
334,It won't make it over it will just go back and forth and go nowhere.Meanwhile if you had a initial drop that was 5m while the hill height was 4m it can make it over.
16,I hope you leanred what it takes to have a fun usable ride and will choose my design.
432,When we ran a trial of 3.5 meters it had a potential energy of 1714 J at the top of the hill and 733 J of kinetic energy but the total energy was still enough to get over the hill and continue to keep going through the rest of the ride.
780,"And having more heights, hills, and drops lead to an exciting ride!"
520,my ride meets all of its requirements people who are pregnant.
375,I believe we should make a roller coaster with a release height of 5m.
229,"Evidence from our data will further prove this point in my first trial my car mass was 40kg and the total energy was 1995 J but in my last trial with a coaster car of 60kg, the total energy is 2933."
837,"That is why I think the height of the initial drop should be 5 meters, the height of the hill should be 2 meters, and the car mass should be 60 kg."
644,"It is easier than you might think, the coaster cart will be a total of 60 kg or more so it will have more energy."
821,The relationship between mass and energy is when you have a heavier mass when it is going down the roller coaster the mass makes the speed goes fast witch is energy.
669,The relationship between drop height and hill heights.
338,"For example if your cart weights 40 kg it will have a total energy of 1,958."
743,"For example, when I tested the drop height of 2 meters, the PE was 883 Joules."
738,The sum of the kinetic energy and the gravitational potential energy.
260,"Also, for example, when testing the drop height of 3.68 meters the pe was 1979 but when I increased the drop height to 4.45 meters the pe was increased at 2391 joules."
632,This is where all potential energy shifts toward kinetic energy to try and make its way up the hill.
677,So the Pe at the top will tranfer to enough ke at the bottom to make it though the loop and hills.
81,Also when the kinetic energy was 976 and the potential energy was 1 the total energy was 977. the data shows that potential energy and kinetic energy combine to make total energy.
631,Lastly comes the 4.75 (meter) hill at the end of the ride.
735,"Total energy, potential energy, kinetic energy."
350,"For example if your cart weighs 40 kg it will have a total energy of 1,958."
25,This is called energy transformation.
426,When I added height to the drop and made it 5 meters high there was 2443 J of energy.
614,If there is a lot of mass in the car then the car will go faster because it is heavier.
221,This statement proves that the law of conservation of energy is backed up by evidence from research.
379,The KE will always be 0 at the top of the initial drop.
263,"The conservation of energy principle ensures that the total energy of the roller coaster remains constant throughout the ride, neglecting any energy losses due to friction or other external factors."
516,It is a huge drop then there is a litle hill half the size of the drop.
551,We had the coaster weight at 40 kg for trial 1.
652,"I also know this because in the add a hill simulation my initial height for all trials was 4 m, in one of my trials the hill height was 5 meters tall and the coaster failed to make it over the hill."
465,"Then it will use the potential energy from going up the hill to go back down, and convert the potential energy to kinetic energy."
421,"The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy can't be created nor destroyed, so the potential energy becomes kinetic energy."
178,"The more PE you have, the less KE you have when it is at the bottom of the initial drop."
137,"So that shows that the relationship between release height and PE is when the release height is higher, the total energy is higher."
500,and I believe i have found the best design.
121,"E1R: On the roller coaster that the Gonzales family decides to make, there needs to be multiple things that are there to make the roller coaster run smoothly."
613,The mass of the car depends on how much energy is put into the track.
449,I will explain to you the design of my roller coaster you will know why my design is the best one for you.
300,E1: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
621,"It will then start first with a 5(meter) initial drop height, this will follow up with a turn turning all the potential energy into kinetic, then will come its first loop."
165,Total energy is always the same as the PE at top of initial drop.
801,"When I increased the drop height to 5 meters, the PE increased to 2697 Joules of PE."
24,As the data shows PE at the top of the initial drop was at 2446J and the PE and the top of the hill was 1474J creating a lot of KE to follow.
99,"So when building the roller coaster, add a hill that is shorter then the initial drop but still pretty big."
148,"But as the roller coaster went down, the energy switched to KE."
371,"And by the bottom of the drop there was no potential energy, only kinetic energy."
576,I did just that.
141,"When the cart made it to the top of the hill which was 3.25 m, the PE was 1341 J."
