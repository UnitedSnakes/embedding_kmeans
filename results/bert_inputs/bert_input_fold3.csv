762,E1: The drop height of my roller coaster will start off being 5m high.
410,The last thing I think we should discuss is the mass of the cart.
387,This proves that the amount of TE does not change.
87,"E1R: Through lots of research, I have figured out the requirements and recommendations for the best roller coaster design so far."
461,One last recommendation I have is to have the mass of the car somewhere between 50 and 60 kilograms.
108,You should also think about the mass of the car.
828,This is because there is more space for the object to hold energy.
497,I hope you will conseder my options and all the tests I took to find the best option for your future rollercoaster.
98,"If the hill is the same height or taller than the initial drop, the car won't have enough KE to make it over."
303,"First it has a fast initial drop down into a tunnel then in slowly climes a hill, gaining 2937 PE to make it over a giant hill."
775,This is because it didn't have enough KE.
192,"First of all, to make sure the car will make it to the end of the coaster we will make the initial drop height be 5 meters high."
334,The first loop would be right after the drop and it would be 3.50m tall and wide.
194,"For example, we tried many trials including drop heights of 2,3,4, and 5 and noticed that as the height of the drop increased the PE also increased."
411,We should have the mass of the cart at 50.
398,The 4th test had 55 kg of mass and had a total energy of 2690.
654,The total energy that is created from the height of the drop will also effect how high we are able to make our hill.
432,"The best mass for the cart, is 50 kg this made it so the total energy was 1951 J."
335,After that there would be a hill that leads into a second loop that is 2.60m tall and wide.
78,You should also think about the mass of the car.
333,The inversions would be 3 loops and one 360 roll the loops would all be different sizes.
158,"If is not, the amount of total energy would be the same for both hills and with all the Potential energy, it still wouldn't be enough to get to the top of the hill."
321,My design has 4 inversions and it starts on a big drop that is guaranteed to give you the most speed.
646,The 55 kilogram car had a total of 2682 jewels of potential energy.
559,And it will not make it to the end of the ride.
798,"This also means that when the car is at the very middle (half the height of the original drop), it will have the same amount of kinetic and potential energy."
144,"The energy cannot be created or destroyed only converted, so when the amount of potential energy goes up the amount of kinetic will go down and vice versa."
363,"On my 4th test it shows that the hill height is 4.10 meters, and has a PE of 2014 at the top of the hill."
740,"To put that in perspective when I tested a car 10 kg lighter it only had 2190, making it not as fun for the riders."
703,Most roller coasters start with a chain to pull them up but my roller coaster will start with an initial drop of 4.0 m. The amount of PE at the top will be 1955 J and the KE at the bottom will be about 1954 J.
466,These are all of the recommendations I have for the new roller coaster.
126,"This means that the total amount of energy that a roller coaster car possesses will stay the same no matter where it is on the track, however the amount of kinetic and potential energy may fluctuate."
664,If the hills are higher the car will be unable to make it over.
251,At the top of a hill there is an amount of KE due to the fact that the car is in motion.
169,"The potential energy was 1957J, but as the cart began to go down the hill, the kinetic energy and potential energy switched."
94,I recommend a higher initial drop to thrill the riders with more speed.
16,My roller coster will have an initial drop of 5 meters and will have a hill right after that is only 2 meters high.
189,"This data also shows how car mass, KE, and PE all have a direct relationship."
157,The height of the initial drop must be higher than the hill that comes after it.
615,When the PE went down the energy converted into the KE.
43,"The 5 meter start height will give the car enough energy to not only finish but also do it faster than it would if it were shorter, the car mass being 60 will also ad more velosity and make the ride more exciting."
510,The reason for this is because it's gaining more energy when going up the hill so the KE will turn into PE.
106,"When the car is going down, it's gaining KE and speed but losing PE."
508,"Once the cars start to move down the initial drop, the PE will get lower and will turn into KE which will get higher."
222,"E1R: Dear Gonzales family,"
548,"Secondly, at the start of the track, the PE is bigger and then when the coaster is going, the KE gets larger."
369,"This has been proven from my 3nd and 4th tests in Mass & Energy data, the mass in the third was 60 kg and had a total energy of 2934."
804,My hill height will be 3 meters.
274,"A roller coaster with a high initial drop height, a hill that is lower than that height and a decently great mass, it is sure to be the most fun roller coaster."
467,E1R: One recommendation I have for the roller coaster is to have the initial drop at 5 meters.
724,E1R: My recomendation is to start with a 5m so we have the greatest amount of PE at the top and the greatest KE at the bottom.
302,I'm mailing you my essay about how my roller coaster would be the most popular attraction and how it would run flawlessly without any problems with it's design.
77,I recommend a hill slightly lower than the initial drop so the riders can experience two high drops.
822,"This way, the cart will still be able to make it over the hill, and it will also be a fun roller coaster."
344,The PE at the top of the drop affects the amount of KE and TE you will have.
702,My roller coaster is going to start with a high drop so energy can be passed through and make the ride fast and fun.
584,"But then in trial 1 when the hill height was 3 meters and the initial drop was 4 meters, the car did make it over the hill because the hill height was less than the initial drop height."
838,If they hills PE is smaller that the hills KE the cart will make it up the hill.
3,When I increased the drop height to 3 meters the potential energy increased 489 joules.
683,E1: I would recommend that the Gonzales family try our coaster because it is fun and exhilarating.
490,This can show us that the rollercoaster cars should have a bigger mass for the rollercoaster to be faster.
401,We think that the smiler would be a great addition to your park.
288,When I tried a 5 meter hill height the car didn't make it to the end because there wasn't enough energy.
112,Examples of this are shown in my data.
789,"For example, when I tested a drop height of 4 meters in the simulation, the car had 1876 Joules of potential energy at the top, which means it also had 1876 Joules of kinetic energy at the bottom."
421,"See, for a roller coaster to be exiting and reach the end, it will first need an initial drop hight, the best hight found, was 4.00 meters."
84,"When I did a car mass of 60kg, the car had a total energy of 2936J of energy and went much faster."
188,"When the car mass was 60 kg the PE and KE were both 2,932 J."
42,I also think they should use a higher number for the car mass like 60.
842,E1R: The drop of my roller coaster is 5m.
583,"Because you can add up the PE and KE at any time in the trial to get the total amount of energy, this shows that energy is never created nor destroyed during the ride."
62,"If you want less KE at the bottom and less PE at the top, choose a lower initial drop."
265,A non-negotiable factor for the best possible roller coaster design would be a decently high drop height.
430,"This would not have worked if the hill was 4.52 meters because there would be 1960 J PE at the top of the hill, thien it will go back to the beginning of the ride, because it is too tall of a hill."
684,The reason our coaster will be awesome is the initial drop is pretty high at the height of 3.75 meters.
575,"And then at the end of the ride, the KE is bigger and the PE is at 0 or 1 joules so then the total energy is bigger."
476,I will start to talk about the Initial drop and hill heights.
208,We also realized how the total energy is always the PE and KE added up and will never be more or less than the PE and KE combined.
736,"This is because they are producing tons of potential energy when they are about to go down a 4-meter hill, 1919 J to be exact."
190,This information helped us decide that we want the initial drop height to be higher than the hill height and we want the mass of the car to be 60 kg because that's what produced the most energy.
90,"If you want less KE at the bottom and less PE at the top, choose a lower initial drop."
471,"If the hill height is the same as or greater than the initial drop height, the car won't have enough energy to continue the ride."
67,A higher initial drop allows the cart to build up more speed and allows you to have higher hills.
465,"When I increased the mass to 50 kilograms, the total energy increased to 2934 Joules."
701,E1: The Gonzales family should choose my roller coaster design because it's not only exciting but it will also be safe.
56,In all of our experiments the both mass & height had a direct relationship with energy.
748,"In our frictionless simulation, the potential energy always equals total energy, and since the 5-meter drop produces 2707 J of potential energy it will produce 2707 J of total energy."
296,The coaster will continue going if PE and KE never transfer into different types of energy.
10,The greater the height the more potential energy.
811,E1R: The drop height of my roller coaster will be 4 meters.
743,I know this because when we proved it in a simulation.
243,The date I collected proves this because in a trial where the initial drop height it 2m the total energy is 1067J.
688,I know this is true because in my trials.
790,"If we compare this to a drop height of 2, which had 938 Joules of potential energy at the top and kinetic energy at the bottom, we can see that the drop height of 4 meters had much more energy."
672,The height of your hills can also affect the roller coaster.
245,"If a hill on the coaster is too tall, the car will not make it over."
759,"Also I had done all of my testing with 0 friction, so I know that most of this info would not actually work with friction but with no friction this info is correct."
117,"E1: Dear Gonzales family,
I hope this letter finds you well."
231,"Best wishes, your roller coaster designer."
367,The mass of the roller coaster (in kg) effects the amount of total energy.
381,The more PE there is the more KE there will be.
785,"Also when my KE at the bottom was 1995J, the total energy was also 1995J, proving total energy stays the same"
840,"IN my data the mass was 40kg and the PE at the top of the drop was 1952, but when the mass was 60kg the PE was 2929."
219,"Is that the cart will go faster down the hill, resulting in a higher speed and more excitement for the riders."
58,It started as 2934 all the way down to 1956J.
171,"So if the hills were the same height it wouldn't have enough total energy to get to the top of the second hill, which is why the initial hill should always be higher than the additional hill."
294,This means it is still present but it is useless for our roller coaster.
79,The mass of the car effects the amount of energy and the speed.
386,"The amount of PE at the top of the initial drop will be the same amount of KE at the bottom, during this process the amount of TE stays the same."
394,My third test has a height of 2 meters and has a PE of 981.
371,This shows that the more mass the more total energy.
519,When I tested the 4m height the cart at the top had 1569 joules of PE and 389 joules of KE.
389,"The law of conservation of energy says that “the amount of energy is neither created nor destroyed."""
758,One thing that I recommend is having a 47-53 kg car so it will have enough weight but not too much.
36,The greater the mass the greater the energy.
372,"With these amazing features and that it will go fast, this is the best roller coaster."
250,"At the top of the Initial drop there is 0 KE, the car's not in motion."
561,"This is because the Law of Conservation of Energy says that energy can not be created, and the only way the car could make it over the hill would be for it to create more energy to move it over the hill."
797,"At the bottom of the hill, the car will have no height, and therefore it will have no potential energy, just kinetic energy."
300,If there is no friction the energy won't change into a different type.
159,This is shown in my data on the subject Add a hill on my first trial.
829,E1: The drop of my roller coaster is 5m.
113,"When I did a car mass of 40kg, the car had a total energy of 1957J of energy and went a decent speed."
644,That changed when we added more or less mass to the car.
676,"The more mass your car has the more total energy, this was proven by yet another student at DAMS."
107,I recommend a hill slightly lower than the initial drop so the riders can experience two high drops.
686,You then go up a hill with a height of 2 meters.
95,A higher initial drop allows the cart to build up more speed and allows you to have higher hills.
525,When I decreased the weight of the cart to 50kg the PE was only 2448 joules while the PE for 60kg was 2937 joules.
498,"E1R: Dear Gonzales family,"
704,"It won't be too low because if it is, there won't be enough energy for it to go over any of the hills."
26,"At any point of the track, adding PE and KE will give you the total energy."
311,"First it has a fast initial drop ,at 5m, down into a tunnel then in slowly climes a hill, gaining 2937 PE to make it over a 2.5m hill."
768,It translated into KE because there is KE when there is motion.
479,"When the rollercoaster started at the top of the initial drop, it had 2449J of Potential Energy and 0J of Kinetic Energy."
85,I also observed that the car with a higher mass lost speed faster when going up.
745,But if you have a 4-meter drop it produces 2164 J.
451,The PE is only 1 Joule because it is barely off the ground at that point.
41,E1: I think the should use the highest intial drop of 5 meters and 4 meters for the hill height.
354,The initial drop will be at 50 meters because it will get a lot PE that will turn into KE for really fast speeds.
212,The roller coaster will not have enough potential energy to make It over the hill if it is higher than the initial drop height.
289,When the height was 3.5 meters the car made it to the end.
439,"This would not have worked if the hill was 4.52 meters because there would be 1960 J PE at the top of the hill, then it will go back to the beginning of the ride, because it is too tall of a hill."
705,"On the topic of hills, my hill will be about 3.52 m high."
673,Another study done by someone at DAMS showed that the hill has to be less than the initial drop height.
442,"If the cart had less mass, it would not have as much energy, for example, a cart with a mass of 43 kg had 1701 J total energy."
577,"But when the car was at the bottom of the initial drop, the PE changed to 1 joule and the KE changed to 2409 joules."
399,This shows that the amount of mass affects the amount of energy.
435,"I hope you feel that my evidence on how hight of initial drop, hight of the hill, and mass effects the energy, and weather or not the car will make it to the end, has convinced you to chose my roller coaster design."
438,"The energy gets distributed throuout the ride and at the top of the hill, the car will have 1844 J PE and KE but then at the end there was only KE left and no PE."
602,More KE more faster the car is moving then we took a hill with a height of 5.00M and the initial drop is still the same height of 4.50M and when the car was at the top of the hill it had a PE of 2200 and a KE of 5 and the car was not able to make it over the hill because the hill was higher than the initial drop.
791,"This higher drop height will also allow the car to accelerate for a longer time, making it go faster."
630,As the cart goes down the drop the PE will change into KE and halfway down it will be 50/50.
513,This is because 5m was the initial drop with the most PE.
786,E1: The drop height of my roller coaster will be 4 meters.
574,"In trial 2 when the release height was 4 meters, the potential energy at the top of the drop was 2145 joules, but in trial 1 when the release height was 5 meters, the potential energy at the top of the drop was 2443 joules."
486,"What I mean by that is when the Energy is higher and the Mass is higher, the cars will move faster on the track."
150,I look forward to working more on your coaster in the future!
164,But as the car moves down the track the Potential energy and Kinetic Energy flip and at the bottom of the hill is where the Kinetic energy will be more than the potential energy.
229,"My reasoning for this is that the cart will go faster down the hill, resulting in a higher speed and more excitement for riders."
560,"I know this because in trial 4 when the hill height was 4.5 meters and the initial drop was 4 meters, the car did not make it over the hill."
320,E1: I think that my design would be the most enjoyable ride for your park.
12,If you put a hill that is 4 meters tall then there will simply not be enough to get over the hill.
124,Something important to understand is the Law of Conservation of Energy.
628,It would have only potential energy (PE) at the top of the initial drop and at the bottom it would have mostly Kinetic energy (KE) at the bottom.
691,In this trial the coaster makes it to the end of the track.
681,A member of Team Blue
446,"When I increased the height to 5 meters, the PE increased to 2443 Joules."
436,"E1R: Dear Gonzales family, you have requested a roller coaster, and I have the best one for you."
283,I recommend a 60 kg car because in my simulation the PE was 2933 at the top and the KE was 1924 at the bottom.
200,"According to the Law of conservation of energy, no mass can be created or destroyed."
468,"In a frictionless roller coaster, the energy is constantly changing from PE to KE depending on the height and motion of the car."
61,"If you want the car to have more KE at the bottom and more PE at the top, choose a high initial drop."
59,"E1: Through lots of research, I have figured out the requirements and recommendations for the best roller coaster design so far."
99,All of the KE will transfer into PE before the car makes it over and the cart will lose it's speed.
233,A non negotiable factor for the best possible roller coaster design would be a decently high drop height.
711,The total amount of energy at the end will be the same as the PE (1959 J).
738,"Lastly, for the mass of the car I was thinking 55 kgs, I think this is the perfect mass because it is safe and produces a lot more potential energy at the top than a lighter car would."
91,This is shown in my data.
17,The car will make if over easily expecially because the mass is 50 kg.
291,At the end of the drop the PE should start rising again in order to get up and down the hill.
693,This shows that my teams coaster would make it to the end because the hill is shorter then the initial drop.
475,"The reason for this assumption is that I have found many ways to make this rollercoaster the most fun, safe and can make it to the end of the track."
429,"The energy gets distributed throuout the ride and at the top of the hill, the car will have 1844 J PE and KE but then at the end there was only KE left."
292,Another component of making it down the hill is conservation of energy.
643,And as it went down the drop and made it to the end the total energy was the same as it was at the top of the initial drop 2707 jewels.
771,"Moving on, I feel the drop height should be 4m."
246,There would be no KE when it got to the highest point of the hill because the car wouldn't be in motion.
528,This was all done in a friction less environment.
518,The hill height will be 4m tall because that was the tallest height with the roller coaster making it over.
114,"When I did a car mass of 60kg, the car had a total energy of 2936J of energy and went much faster."
697,This also creates a lot of speed and g force making the ride fun and exciting.
596,E1: I think that our roller coaster is the best design because we have done tests and we have figured out the only way it will make it to the end is that the initial drop has to have the greatest height out of everything.
532,E1R: The drop height of my roller coaster will be 5m tall.
109,The mass of the car effects the amount of energy and the speed.
34,"The car will obly have enough energy to get up three meters, energy can't be created so the car won't get over the hill."
784,"To prove this, when my PE was 1995J and KE was 0J, the total energy stayed the same."
531,I conclude that these design choices would make the best roller coaster for your families theme park.
494,"The reason for that is because once the cars start to move, the KE will get higher because it's in motion."
765,"When I increased the height to 5m, the PE was 2553J."
336,There would be a turn after that and on that turn there would be a 360 degree roll.
385,"In one of my many tests the PE was 1785 at the top (the same as the TE) of the initial drop and 1784 at the bottom of the initial drop, which was also the same as the TE."
353,"I will explain the science behind it and what there will be(hills and drop height, plus the mass of the coaster)."
195,"To be specific, when the height was 4 meters, the PE was 1,955 J and when the height was 5 meters the PE was 2,443 J which also increased the total energy."
464,"For example, when I had a mass of 40 kilograms, the total energy was 1956 Joules."
729,"After the initial drop we will have 2 loops, then I hill with a height of 4.5m."
293,Energy can change into non-mechanical types of energy.
420,"E1: Dear Gonzales family, you have requested a roller coaster, and I have the best one for you."
15,The greater the mass the greater the energy.
32,When the car starts 3 meters tall the potenial energy is 1466 joules.
562,"But, it can't because of the Law of Conservation."
482,That experiment shows that the hill height has to be lower than the Initial drop height otherwise the cars will not get over the hill.
825,"So when the PE turns to zero at the bottom, it doesn't just disappear."
404,The initial drop should be 5.00 because the PE at the top of the drop was enough to let it get over hills for example the PE at the top was 2443 and at the bottom KE was at 0.
115,I also observed that the car with a higher mass lost speed faster when going up.
661,Our roller coaster is the best option for your theme park.
581,"Also, in trial 5 when the release height was 5 meters, at the top of the drop the PE was 2443 joules and the KE was 0 joules."
281,So I recommend a higher amount of PE and KE so there is more energy and velocity.
271,In this case the energy comes from a greater mass and therefore a greater speed.
589,"But then in trial 1 when the mass was the least it could be at 40 kg, the PE was 1567 joules at the top of the initial drop."
132,"The big takeaways are that a good roller coaster has a high initial drop height, a car with a large mass, and doesn't have any hills with heights higher than the initial drop height."
375,E1R: To the Gonzales family.
330,This is because you have enough energy to make it up the hill.
617,when the roller car goes down the coaster the PE energy converted into the kinetic energy.
787,"This drop height will allow the roller coaster to have lots of potential energy at the top of the drop, which will help it keep going throughout the whole ride."
40,So it is really fin and fast but it is still safe.
254,More energy is required to get over a hill that is taller than the initial drop height.
687,You will have more then enough kinetic energy to make it to the top of this hill.
346,For example your PE and KE at the top and bottom of the drop must be greater than your PE and KE at the top and bottom of the hill if it is not you will not make it over the the hill.
247,In a trial with the hill height of 5m and the initial drop height of 4.5m the car didn't not go over and had 0 KE and the highest point it could be on the hill.
757,"Another thing that would have to be thought about is the weight, because with it being too heavy would mean that it might not make it up the next hill."
217,I also recommend a heavy cart.
101,"When i did a hill height of 4 meters and an initial drop of 5 meters, the car made it to the end."
485,"The higher the initial drop is, the more energy you will have, and based on the mass of the car, the faster it will go."
129,Assuming nothing else is different between the coasters a coaster car with a mass of 50kg will have more energy than a coaster car with a mass of 40kg and less energy than a coaster car with a mass of 60kg.
499,"When energy cannot be created or destroyed, the energy continues to switch from PE to KE."
93,"When the initial drop was 5 meters tall, the car had 2688J of energy."
431,"If the car is much heavier, it will have a lot of energy, but it wont have as much if it is light."
457,"When I had the initial drop height at 5 meters, and the hill height also at 5 meters, the car did not make it to the end of the ride."
680,"Sincerely,"
261,In this case the energy come from a greater mass and therefore a greater speed.
22,"For example, when my drop height was 2 meters the potential energy was 977 joules."
343,The PE at the top of the hill was 2934 and as it moved down the hill all of that energy transferred into KE you can see this because at the bottom of the hill the KE was 2932 while the PE was 2.
571,"E1R: Dear Gonzales Family,"
322,The roller coaster will carry speed because every time you go on an inversion you gain speed.
316,"Like in one of my experiments where the hill and initial drop were both 5m and they coaster didn't make it over the hill, making in roll back and fourth."
120,Assuming nothing else is different between the coasters a coaster with an initial drop height of 3m will have more energy than a coaster with a drop height of 2m and less energy than a coaster with an drop height of 4m.
717,"This proves that height of the drop relates to the PE at the top and the KE at the bottom, we can also tell from these trials that the PE, the KE, and the TE (total energy) have the same values in each trial."
168,At the top of the initial hill which was 5m.
610,When making a roller coaster your initial drop has to have the most height if your initial height is not bigger than a hiil height or loop height it won't have enuff KE to make it over the hill.
652,Because of the height of our drop there is going to be more potential energy at the top of the coaster due to the amount of track that it has to go down.
47,The 5 meter start height will give the car enough potential energy to not only finish but also do it fast and fun.
324,The drop height in my trial was 5.00m this was high enough to provide enough total energy to take you through the ride.
0,E1: The drop height of my roller coster is going to be 5 meters.
835,No energy is gained or lost.
347,This is all possible because of TE.
549,"And then at the end of the ride, the KE is bigger and the PE is 0 or 1 so then the total energy is bigger."
412,The cart should be at 50 because the bigger the mass of the cart the faster we go.
167,The car mass was 40kg.
312,The cart will be 60Kg because through out my research that's the weight that gave me the most PE(2937) and KE(2933) energy in all my simulations.
379,While a height of 4.62 meters has 2255 PE.
742,"If the drop height is 5 the cart has the most potential energy it can, 2707 J to be exact."
516,This initial drop height will optimum for most energy right at the start of the roller coaster drop.
207,"This data also shows how car mass, KE, and PE all have a direct relationship."
460,"The reason it would be more fun is that it would have more PE, and therefore would convert to more KE at the bottom of the hill and move faster."
448,"At the bottom of the initial drop at 5 meters, the KE was 2442 Joules."
763,"5 meters high will then have more energy, which will make the roller coaster go faster."
576,"In trial 5, when the release height was 4.5, the PE at the top was 2410 joules and the KE was 0."
359,This is because in one of my tests I had the hill at 5 meters and the initial drop at 5 meters.
540,When the hill was 4m tall the PE at the top was 1958 joules.
64,"When the initial drop was 2 meters tall, the car only had 1071J of energy."
349,The law conservation of energy plays into roller coasters because the energy always has to go somewhere and this rule applies when PE turns into KE.
270,A car with a mass of 60kg moves faster along the track compared to a car with a mass of 40kg.
844,When the cart was at the bottom of the hill the PE was 0 and the KE was 1952.
710,The PE at the top of the drop will be 1959 J and the KE at the bottom is 1956 J.
155,E1R: If I were to design a roller coaster for the Gonzales theme park.
546,"In trial 2 when the release height was 4 meters, the potential energy at the top of the drop was 2145, but in trial 1 when the release height was 5 meters, the potential energy at the top of the drop was 2443."
651,E1R: The drop height of our car is going to be 5 meters tall.
544,"First off, when considering the height of the initial drop of the coaster, the initial drop height impacts the total energy of the roller coaster."
635,The car mass will be 55 kg making it have a lot of energy to make it to the end of the ride.
419,E1R: Dear Gondolas Family Some co-workers and I plan on trying to help you make a roller coaster ride for your park we found some things to help that I will tell you in the next few paragraphs.
756,Other wise it won't make it with the amount of KE it has left.
403,So we can make this ride the best ride for the riders we should make the height for the initial drop 5.00.
764,"For example, when the height was 4m high, the PE was 1955J."
418,And it has the perfect mass of the cart to give the riders the feeling that they are going fast.
213,"The higher the PE at the top of the initial drop, the higher the KE at the bottom."
176,"For example, we tried many trials including drop heights of 2,3,4, and 5 and noticed that as the height of the drop increased the PE also increased."
679,"Thanks for considering us to build your roller coaster, we can help make it fun and safe to make the theme park the best it can be!"
733,"Another important factor that makes the drop perfect is the fact that the cart goes the fastest, which makes it the most entertaining."
256,This roller coaster car also will need a decent amount of mass.
819,"When I increased the drop height to 3.00 meters, the potential energy increased to 1319 joules."
474,I am writing today about why my rollercoaster is the better design.
831,For example When the hight was 5m the carts PE at the top was 1952 and KE was 0.
796,"If kinetic energy increases by 10 Joules, then potential energy decreases by 10 Joules."
780,"By doing this, the car will have more energy making it able to go faster in the long run."
205,"For instance, when the car mass was 50 kg the PE and KE were both 2,443 J."
202,"When the drop height was greater than the hill height, the car had enough PE to make it over the hill."
550,"In trial 5, when the release height was 4.5, the PE at the top was 2410."
29,"Once it is at the very bottom, potential energy has 0 joules and kinetic energy has the total amount because kinetic energy is involved with velocity."
241,There is all KE at the bottom or end of the coaster due to the motion of the coaster.
692,Where as in trial 3 the initial drop is 3.75 meters and the hill is 4 meters tall causing the coaster to be unable get over the hill.
18,"After the hill the car will be able to go farther will hills, loops, ect."
37,My roller coster will have an initial drop of 5 meters and will have a hill right after that being only 2 meters high.
598,Another thing that would help the car make it all the way through is more mass.
235,The initial drop height affects the amount of total energy present.
552,"This happened because at the top of the roller coaster, there is a ton of stored-up energy (PE) in the car because it's not moving."
779,"But when I increased the mass to 60kg, the PE was 2349J."
331,For example if you have a hill that is the same height as the drop you will not make it up the hill.
396,The mass of the roller coaster (in kg) affects the amount of total energy.
782,"To end this, I hope you take my proposal for my first design for the roller coaster."
364,My third test has a height of 2 meters and has a PE if 981.
218,My reasoning for this.
178,As the PE increased the KE also increased at the bottom of the initial drop and the more KE energy it has then the more energy it will have to make it to the end of the coaster.
557,"Because you can add up the PE and KE to get the total amount of energy, this shows that energy is never created nor destroyed during the ride."
382,"I know this because in one of my tests the amount of PE on the top of the initial drop was 1956, and the amount of KE at the bottom was 1954."
162,"At the top of the additional hill the potential energy was 2449J and the kinetic energy was 0 so it had no more energy to go farther, so the cart didnt have enough kinetic energy to get past the second hill."
440,It would also not get to the end if the hill was the same hight as the initial drop.
242,"The higher the initial drop, the more total energy there is."
81,"If you want less energy and less speed, you should have a cart with less mass."
707,"If not, the car may not make it all to the end or even over the hill."
304,Once it drops converting it all into 2933 KE and allowing it to make it over the hill and into a drop.
374,Sincerely the Angle company.
24,"When the car got to the bottom of the drop, the kinetic energy was greater the more height it had at the begining."
818,"For example, when I tested the drop height of 2.00 meters, the potential energy was 876 joules."
423,I found in the simulation that 3.75 meters is the best option.
342,You gain speed by turning the KE into PE and then the PE will turn back into KE giving you speed this speed will carry you through the next inversion.
491,One more thing I have been watching is how the energy is able to change from PE to KE.
808,"With a drop height of 4 meters and a hill height of 3 meters, the drop will be larger than the hill, but the hill will still be big enough to be fun and exciting."
263,"Even a slight mistake or change in certain aspects of the coaster could affect the integrity making the coaster not able to be ridden, therefore it is extremely important to be precises and understand the science behind making a roller coaster work."
582,"And then at the end of the initial drop, the PE was 1 joule and the KE was 2442 joules."
744,"For example, when we tested it a 3-meter drop only produces 1,624 J of potential energy."
444,This height is the best option because it would have the most potential energy to keep the ride going for as long as possible.
133,I look forward to working more on your coaster in the future!
249,The total energy would equal the amounts of KE and PE.
400,E1: Dear Gondolas Family Some co-workers and I plan on trying to help you make a roller coaster ride for your park we found some things to help that I will tell you in the next few paragraphs.
588,And the KE it had at the bottom of the drop was 2347 joules and the total amount of energy was 2350 joules.
527,"Having the cart be heavier will allow it to go further on the roller coaster, if it was friction less."
524,The weight of the cart will be 60kg because that was the cart with the most PE at the top of the hill.
639,E1: The drop height of our car is going to be 5 meters tall.
9,"Potential energy is based on three things, one of them is height."
63,This is shown in my data.
478,I tested this by making the initial drop height 5m tall and the hill height also being 5m tall.
619,when I measured the PE at the top of the initial the the PE was 1221 and the kinetic energy at the top of the drop was 3.
604,Now this is way I think you should use our Roller Coaster.
23,When I increased the drop height to 3 meters the potential energy increased 489 joules.
66,I recommend a higher initial drop to thrill the riders with more speed.
816,"Having a decent amount of total energy will make it easier for the cart to make it over the hill, and loop."
774,"For example, when I did 4m, it made it over the hill fine, but when I did 5m, it didn't make it over."
4,"When the car got to the bottom of the drop, the kinetic energy was greater the more height it had at the begining."
595,E1R: i choose fun to have a bigger drop
778,"For example, when the car mass was 50kg, the PE was 1958J."
416,Because it has the perfect hill height to give riders that thrill.
378,I know this because in my tests I found out that an initial drop with 2 meters has 977 PE.
578,And the total energy of the roller coaster was 2410.
380,This shows that the height of the initial drop affects the amount of energy.
826,Instead it transfers into kinetic energy.
309,And that Gonzales family is why I know my roller coaster will out preform and work better than any other roller coaster you might see.
38,The car will make if over easily expecially because the mass is 50 kg.
675,The hill with a height of 4.5m had 589 more joules of PE than a hill height of 3.51m.
352,"This is the Angle roller coaster company, and im going to tell you about the coolest roller coaster ever."
69,The car needs enough KE to go over the hill.
313,"Like in my first simulation 50 kg and 5m initial drop, it only had 2448 PE and 2444 KE at the end of the initial drop."
53,In our experiment 2152J was the most energy out of all the hill heights and we got it from 4 meters.
221,"Best wishes,"
323,You gain speed by turning the KE into PE and then the PE will turn back into KE giving you enough speed for the ride.
810,My car's mass is going to be 50 kg because then the car will have enough energy to make it through the ride but it won't have too much mass.
244,A trial with an initial drop height of 4m has a total energy of 2124J.
719,"after the initial drop we will have 2 loops, then I hill with a height of 4.5m."
555,"For example In trial 3 when the release height was 3.75, at the top the PE was 2023 and the KE was 0 and then at the end of the ride, the PE was 1 and the KE was 2022, showing that when adding the PE and KE, they will always equal the total energy."
267,"With an initial drop height of 4.5m and a hill height of 2m, the car would surely go over."
722,At the End of the coaster there will be a bank that goes up 5.5 M. The goal of the ride is for the coaster car to just barely not make it up the hill and then fall back down and do the coaster again but this time backwards.
761,"When I increased the drop height to 5 meters there was 2443 joules, the PE increased by 1466 joules."
815,"The more potential energy you have, the more total energy you have."
800,"The energy doesn't disappear, it just changes form."
92,"When the initial drop was 2 meters tall, the car only had 1071J of energy."
515,When i decreased the height to 4m the PE deceased to 1564 joules.
234,The initial drop height of the coaster has a huge impact whether or not the roller coaster will work.
812,"This means that there will always be the same amount of total energy, and so the ride will never stop unless it gets stopped by another force."
228,"However, at the top of the hill, the KE is used because of the drop changing the PE to KE."
408,We have 518 KE at the bottom of the hill which will go down the more we go up and go up the more we go down so it's enough to help us get over the hill.
266,The data I collected proves this because in a trial where the initial drop height is 2m the total energy is 1067J.
776,"Lastly, I would like to make the mass of the car 60kg."
480,"Once the cars dropped down the hill, the carts used all of the Potential Energy and made it up to the top of the hill."
500,"If the initial drop height was 5m, the total energy was 2447J."
572,"There are many things that need to go into the design of the roller coaster to make it safe, working, and fun."
216,"The reason for this is that energy cannot be created, so if your drop height is low, the ride isn't going to have enough PE and KE through for it to be exciting."
523,The 4m hill had the least amount of energy loss in out friction less environment.
832,But when the cart was at the bottom of the hill the PE was 0 and the KE was 1952.
310,E1R: Hello Gonzales family!
529,"If there was friction the hill height would have to be less than half the size of out initial drop, but that's no fun."
685,This will create a lot of speed and g force making the ride fun and exciting.
149,"The big takeaways are that a good roller coaster has a high initial drop height, a car with a large mass, and doesn't have any hills with heights higher than the initial drop height."
625,if the mass is in the middle range that means the energy is medium speed.
100,"When I did an initial height of 5 meters and a hill height of 5 meters, the cart did not make it over."
166,This is shown in my data on trial three of Mass & Energy.
813,E1: The drop height of my roller coaster is 5.00 meters.
170,"The kinetic energy was now 1955J at the bottom of the initial hill, and the amount of total energy, 1957J stays the same throughout."
618,E1R: As we start our roller coaster to the height of 5 meters.
658,"E1: Dear the Gonzales family,"
794,"At the top of the hill, the car will only have potential energy because it is not moving."
286,In order to keep the coaster going the whole time we're going to need to have a hill height of around 3.5 meters.
671,They found that the drop height of 4.5m had 293 less joules of PE than the drop point of 5m.
565,And the KE it had at the bottom of the drop was 2347 and the total amount of energy was 2350.
543,"In this essay, I will be showing you what you need to include in your design and other facts to know about when it comes to energy and roller coasters."
649,This result occurred because of the total amount of energy was able to be used for the car.
13,"The energy can't be created or distroyed, the car only has enough to get up 3 meters."
601,Then we did some tests with hill height we first set the initial drop to 4.50M then we added a hill with a height of 2.50M when the car reached the top of the hill it had 1226 PE and 974 KE which means it was still moving at good speeds and made it to the end.
52,"And putting the hill height to 4 or less it would make it over, but 4 adds the most excitement and speed."
198,"When we set the release height at 4 meters, the total energy was 1,955 J but when we increased the release height to 5 meters the total energy was 2,443 J."
339,The mass affects the PE and the PE affects the KE because when moving down a drop all of the PE will turn into KE.
402,We have tested a few things and the first thing I would like to discuss is the height that I think is best for your roller coaster.
802,"At the bottom of the hill, there will 938 Joules of kinetic energy and 0 Joules of potential energy."
623,The mass of the car was 50 grams.
483,"The relationship between KE, PE, and total energy will affect everyone's ride when they are on the rollercoaster."
83,"When I did a car mass of 40kg, the car had a total energy of 1957J of energy and went a decent speed."
160,I set my initial height and my additional hill height both to 5m.
566,"But then in trial 1 when the mass was the least it could be 40 kg, the PE was 1567 at the top of the initial drop and the total energy was."
580,"For example in trial 3 when the release height was 3.75 meters, at the top of the drop the PE was 2023 joules and the KE was 0 joules and then at the end of the initial drop, the PE was 1 joule and the KE was 2022 joules, showing that when adding up the PE and KE, they will always equal the total energy at any point during the roller coaster ride."
569,"All of these ideas above are more than recommendations, they are requirements to make it the best, most safe, and fully functioning roller coaster you'll ever see."
351,E1: To the Gonzales family.
713,E1: My recomendation is to start with a 5m so we have the greatest amount of PE at the top and the greatest KE at the bottom.
395,"This shows that the higher the hill, the more PE which also means more KE as explained previously."
536,The total energy and the PE at the start of the coaster are the same.
214,"The higher the KE at the bottom, the better."
355,"The more PE there is the more KE there will be, I know this because in one of my test the amount of PE on the top of initial drop was 1956, and the amount of KE at the bottom of drop was 1954."
735,I think this because it would give the riders the most suspense when they are going up the hill.
473,"E1: Dear Gonzales family,"
747,This also means that it will have the most total energy on the ride at 2707 J.
54,"And since we are making an original roller coaster in the sence of only reliing 
The car mass as 60 will add to the speed of the coaster and make the ride more exciting."
180,"When we set the release height at 4 meters, the total energy was 1,955 J but when we increased the release height to 5 meters the total energy was 2,443 J."
547,"This shows that when the height of the roller coaster is increased, the potential energy goes up."
539,For example when the coaster is at the top of the hill some of the initial PE is turned into KE.
406,Another thing we should discuss is the height of the hill I think the height of the hill should be 3.00.
273,"Even a slight mistake or change in certain aspects of the coaster could affect the integrity, making the coaster not able to be ridden.Therefore it is extremely important to be precise and understand the science behind making a roller coaster work."
463,"That makes for a fun and safe ride because when it converts to KE, it will continue throughout the ride and move faster than a car with less mass would."
645,"We started by adding 5 more kilograms to our car to test if the total energy would go up as we added more mass, and it did exactly that."
209,This information helped us decide that we want the initial drop height to be higher than the hill height and we want the mass of the car to be 60 kg because that's what produced the most energy.
783,E1R: The drop height of my roller coaster will start off being 5m high.
806,"If the hill height was larger than the initial drop height, the car would not have enough energy to get up the hill."
542,"E1: There are many things that need to go into the design of the roller coaster to make it safe, working, and fun."
750,"1919 J of potential energy will turn into 1919 J of kinetic energy, thus making the riders go very fast."
210,"E1: Dear Gonzales family,"
674,They also found that the higher the hill the more PE it has at the top.
459,"At this height, it's short enough to continue on the ride, but it's tall enough to be a fun ride."
428,the initial drop.
698,I know we won't lose any energy because of the law of conservation of energy.
174,"First of all, to make sure the car will make it to the end of the coaster we will make the initial drop height be 5 meters high."
760,E1R: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
135,My team and I have discovered much about the physics of roller coasters in the past couple of days.
206,"When the car mass was 60 kg the PE and KE were both 2,932 J."
325,The PE at the top of the drop affects the amount of KE you will have at the bottom of the drop.
514,When I tested the 5m initial drop the PE was 1955 joules.
600,We also did some tests with the initial drop and we tested the height at 2.50M it had a PE of 1222 and then we did another test but the height was at 5.00M it had a PE of 2443.
137,Assuming nothing else is different between the coasters a coaster with an initial drop height of 3m will have more energy than a coaster with a drop height of 2m and less energy than a coaster with an drop height of 4m.
487,"I also tested this out by having a starting initial drop height of 5m, the amount of total energy is 2938J, and the mass of the car is 60kg."
427,"The hill will be 3.75 meters, this ensures that the car will make it to the end because it is a lower hight than"
373,I have put a lot of thought into this and hope these recommendations will be helpful.
390,This proves that the TE will stay the same.
341,E1R: I think that my design would be the most enjoyable ride for your park.
520,When I decreased the height to 3m then the PE at the top of the hill was 1179 joules.
173,E1: For our teams roller coaster design we will design it to be exciting but also make it to the end of the ride without stopping.
252,The PE at the top of the initial drop equals the PE+KE at the top of the hill.
279,In my model the higher the KE and PE the higher the TE.
567,"This shows that the greater the mass of the car, the more PE, KE and total energy it will have."
426,"At 4.00 meters, my roller coaster will have 1958 J total energy."
332,The height of the hill has to be just right to gain more speed and carry it through the ride.
537,For example when the PE was 1564 joules the total energy was also 1564 joules.
272,"As mentioned before and clearly highlighted, there are many factors that go into creating the perfect roller coaster."
708,"So the shorter the hill, the more of a chance to make it over."
712,E1R: The Gonzales family should choose my roller coaster design because it's not only exciting but it will also be safe.
659,Hello!
746,That is a big factor in the excitement of the roller coaster that you and your family are wanting to have in this roller coaster.
621,When the PE went down the energy converted into the kinetic energy.
177,"To be specific, when the height was 4 meters, the PE was 1,955 J and when the height was 5 meters the PE was 2,443 J which also increased the total energy."
522,"Since the 5m hill didn't work for the cart, the 4m hill will be the choice."
677,They found that a car with a mass of 55 kg had 254 less joules of PE than a car with a mass of 60kg.
803,"This shows that the energy changed from potential to kinetic, but isn't completely gone."
305,With a inversion and then slowing down into a flat area keeping the total energy the same because all the PE turned into KE when it went down the initial drop.
449,My PE was 1 Joule.
76,"When the car is going down, it's gaining KE and speed but losing PE."
301,E1: Hello Gonzales family!
184,"When the drop height was greater than the hill height, the car had enough PE to make it over the hill."
767,"After the roller coaster reached the bottom of the drop, there was no PE because there was no height, and it all translated into KE."
634,My idea for the coaster is to have an initial drop height of 5 meters and a hill height of 3 meters.
258,"A greater mass allows the car to move faster, the faster the car is moving the more energy it has."
772,"I decided on this because we still want the ride to be fun, so having a bigger hill would be more enjoyable."
568,And the car will also go faster when it is has a greater mass and slower when it has a smaller mass.
807,"when I tested a drop height of 3 meters and a hill height of 4 meters, the car did not make it up the hill and just fell back down instead."
143,"This means that the total amount of energy that a roller coaster car possesses will stay the same no matter where it is on the track, however the amount of kinetic and potential energy may fluctuate."
647,"The same applied to the Kinetic energy of the coaster, the more mass you add to the car the more acceleration the car will have due to gravity adding more kinetic energy to the car."
506,"Also when the Energy is higher and the Mass is higher, the cars will move faster on the track."
817,"Although, you don't want the drop height to be too large, or else the ride won't be safe."
391,"I am going to add 2 hills, one will be 43 meters and the other 39 meters."
357,"I am going to add 2 hill, one will be 43 meters and the other 39 meters."
70,"If the hill is the same height or taller than the initial drop, the car won't have enough KE to make it over."
570,"I promise that if you follow my ideas, you're sure to bring in a ton of business and have your visitors having fun for the whole day."
670,Proof of this can be found in an experiment done by someone at Deforest area middle school.
161,The potential energy at the top of the initial hill was 2449J and the kinetic energy was 0J.
248,If it did make it over the hill then the amount of KE and PE at the top of the hill was dependent on the height of the hill.
318,"Another reason why I chose this coaster is because it had the most total energy in all my simulations, the closest one was at 2448 which is a good distance away from the best one."
734,"For hills, I think a 4-meter hill would be perfect."
700,So I know the energy will be the same every time allowing the coaster to make it to the end every single time.
690,This is shown in trial 1 of adding hills where the initial drop is 3.75 meters and the hill is 2 meters.
489,"When I tested the smaller mass of 40kg, and an initial drop of 5m tall, the total energy was only able to get up to 1959J."
414,So I think we should have it at 50 because then it's the perfect weight to get the cart to go fast and still get over the hills.
594,E1: i choose fun to have a bigger drop
215,"Because if you want a new and exciting ride, you're going to need a high drop height."
240,This is the reason that all of the present energy is PE.
319,And all energy in this model is just PE and KE converting into each other once they go down a drop or up a hill.
405,This shows that we will have enough energy to send the cart at fast speeds.
737,1919 J of potential energy will turn into 1919 J of kinetic energy thus making the riders go very fast.
230,"For example in my trials, 60kg resulted in the highest amount of total energy at the end, while 40kg resulted in the lowest amount of total energy in other words, less speed."
417,It has the drop at the start to get the roller coaster moving.
530,This design would be the most fun design because it has a large drop and hill which will allow the people to feel the drop for longer.
752,This is because when you have a high drop height it means that the rest of your roller coaster could be longer because there will be more energy so that you can have a longer track.
472,"When I had the initial drop height at 5 meters, and the hill height at 5 meters, the car did not make it to the end of the ride."
345,The TE effects whether you will make it through the ride.
376,"This is the Angle roller coaster company, and im going to tell you about the coolest rollercoaster ever."
492,When the rollercoaster starts up higher it will have more PE at the top and more total energy all together.
501,"When the initial drop height was 2m, the total energy was 977J."
306,The cart will be 60Kg because through out my research that's the weigt that gave me the most PE(2937) and KE(2933) energy in all my simulations.
801,"For example, at the top of the initial drop, there were 938 Joules of potential energy and 0 Joules of kinetic energy."
694,E1R: I would recommend that the Gonzales family try our coaster because it is fun and exhilarating.
608,There isn't really I big difference between PE and KE the why it works is the energy transformation and law conservation of energy.
458,"If we had the initial drop at 5 meters, then a good hill height would be 4.5 meters."
657,"And as it went down the drop and made it to the end the total energy was the same as it was at the top of the initial drop, 2707 jewels of energy."
830,This relates to PE and KE.
781,"Yes, it will accelerate slower, but it would be faster."
723,At the end of the ride the car will end up back at the begining then come to a stop using a brake mechanism.
116,This is because gravity has more of an effect on the heavier object.
328,The more PE you have at the top of the hill affects the amount of KE you will have by the end of the hill.
225,"For example, in my research, I found that the higher PE let's say the initial PE is 2443 and the initial KE is 0."
682,"E1R: Dear the Gonzales family,"
50,And we noticed the total energy went from 2668 to 2134J then went lower and lower each time we went down.
239,"This is due to the fact that, at the top of the track the car is not in motion and therefore storing energy."
725,In our initial drop trials the PE at the top of the hill was 782J the same can be said for the KE at the bottom of the ramp this means that PE transfers into KE.
715,We can see this in our initial drop trials when the PE is 782 J (in trial 1) the KE is also 782 J.
793,"This means that there will always be the same amount of total energy, and so the ride will never stop unless it gets stopped by something else."
134,"E1R: Dear Gonzales family,
I hope this letter finds you well."
326,I also tested the different hill heights and how they would effect the ride.
592,"This shows that the greater the mass of the car, the more PE, KE, and total energy it will have."
739,When I tested it in the simulation I found that the car had 2712 J of potential energy.
285,Once again we want high PE and KE so a 60 kg car would be best.
512,E1: The drop height of my roller coaster will be 5m tall.
517,The hill height will be 4m tall.
716,When we increase the height of the hill the PE is 1173 J (in trial 2) and so is the KE.
299,Meaning energy can change into non-mechanical types of energy.
8,"Once it is at the very bottom, potential energy has 0 joules and kinetic energy has the total amount because kinetic energy is involved with velocity."
751,E1: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
709,My car will have a mass of 55.
138,"Additionally, when a car is at the top of a hill there is only potential energy and no kinetic."
526,The PE for a cart of 40kg was only 1958 which was the least amount of joules in our tests.
653,And it will have the same amount of Kinetic energy going down from the initial drop.
65,"When the initial drop was 5 meters tall, the car had 2688J of energy."
46,"E1R: I think the initial drop should be 5 meters, the hill height should be 4 meters and the car mass be 60."
275,E1: My recommendation for the Gonzales family is to have the drop height at 5 meters.
191,E1R: For our teams roller coaster design we will design it to be exciting but also make it to the end of the ride without stopping.
39,"After the hill the car will be able to go farther will hills, loops, ect."
741,E1R: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
314,Showing that 60 kg is the best weight to use
637,"In addition, TE is the total amount of energy of the cart, not one specific energy, but all of them."
495,"When the cars start to up the hill, the KE will get lower and the PE will get higher."
384,I also found that the total energy changed even when the PE changed to KE.
541,At the top of the hill though the PE was 1569 joules and the KE was 389 joules.
511,I hope you will consider my options and all the tests I took to find the best option for your future rollercoaster.
648,"The hill height was important to add some thought into as well, if our hill was as high as the initial drop it would not have been possible to even make it over the hill."
196,As the PE increased the KE also increased at the bottom of the initial drop and the more KE energy it has then the more energy it will have to make it to the end of the coaster.
86,This is because gravity has more of an effect on the heavier object.
605,E1R: I think that our roller coaster is the best design because we have done tests and we have figured out the only way it will make it to the end is that the initial drop has to have the greatest height out of everything.
182,"According to the Law of conservation of energy, no mass can be created or destroyed."
821,"The reason I am doing this is because after the initial drop, there is only enough energy made to make it over a hill either the same size, or smaller than the initial drop."
678,"Overall in order to have a successful roller coaster you need to have a high drop height, hills shorter than the initial drop height, and a car with a heavier mass."
88,The amount of energy during the initial drop correlates with the height of it.
20,E1R: The drop height of my roller coster is going to be 5 meters.
220,I hope you will consider my advice.
57,For mass we started with 60kg and went down from there to 40 and every time the total energy shrunk.
642,"This is true in our data also, when we had let it go from 5 meters its potential energy at the top of the drop was 2707 jewels of energy."
496,The reason for this is because its gaining more energy when going up the hill so the KE will turn into PE.
259,A car having the mass of 60kg moves faster along the track compared to a car with the mass of 40kg.
297,E1R: My recommendation for the Gonzales family is to have the drop height at 5 meters.
72,"When I did an initial height of 5 meters and a hill height of 5 meters, the cart did not make it over."
443,E1: One recommendation I have for the roller coaster is to have the initial drop at 5 meters.
393,"The reason I want them tall is because the higher the hill, the more PE."
337,Then there would be one last loop that is 2.00m tall and wide and then the ride would be over.
593,And the car will also go faster when it has a greater mass and then slower when it has a smaller mass because it has more energy which leads to a faster speed.
587,"I know this because in trial 4 when the car had the greatest mass of 60 kilograms (kg), the amount of PE it had at the initial drop was 2350 joules."
841,This also aplies to KE.
360,The coaster did not make it over the hill because the hill and drop were the same height.
278,5 meters would be my best recommendation because more PE makes it faster and more KE will keep it safe.
227,The reason for this is most of the PE was used up on the initial drop and no KE was used.
721,"We know this because of our Hills Data, in those trials the car only went up the hill when the hill height was lower than the drop height."
521,The KE for the 3m hill was 776 at the top.
613,when I measured the PE at the top of the initial the the PE was 1221 and the KE at the top of the drop was 3.
153,"So if the hills were the same height it wouldn't have enough total energy to get to the top of the second hill, which is why the initial hill should always be higher than the additional hill."
731,I think it should be 5 meters because that is the max amount that we can go to still be safe.
509,"The reason for that is that once the cars start to move, the KE will get higher because it's in motion."
2,"For example, when my drop height was 2 meters the potential energy was 977 joules."
836,Drop hight and hill hight arre simaler because the hill needs the drop.
727,"When we changed the mass the energy of the car when from 1957J to 2446J, thus prving that mass has a direct relationship with energy."
111,"If you want less energy and less speed, you should have a cart with less mass."
284,But with the 40 kg car the PE was 1955 and the KE was 1951.
49,We started with 5 meters and kept going down by a meter.
660,I am writing to you to discuss the best roller coaster design.
551,"But as the car moved down the initial drop, the PE changed to 1 and the KE changed to 2409."
585,"This is because the Law of Conservation of Energy says that energy can not be created nor destroyed, and the only way the car could make it over the hill would be for it to create more energy to move it over the hill."
481,"Once the car was at the top of the hill, all of its Kinetic energy was forced back into Potential energy and was left with no more Kinetic energy to keep moving over the hill."
127,"The energy cannot be created or destroyed only converted, so when the amount of potential energy goes up the amount of kinetic will go down and vice versa."
445,"When I had my initial drop height at 3 meters, the PE at the top of the drop was 1466 Joules."
730,E1: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
456,"If the hill height is the same as or greater than the initial drop height, then the car won't have enough total energy to continue the ride."
327,The hill height effects the amount of PE you will have at the top of the hill.
19,So it is really fin and fast but it is still safe.
415,"In conclusion, I think you should the Smiler to your park."
773,"But if we make the hill too high, then the roller coaster wouldn't be able to make it over the hill."
507,When the rollercoaster starts up higher it will have more PE at the top and more total energy together.
366,"Also, the mass of the roller coaster has to be above 55 kg or more."
232,E1: There are many contributing factors and variables that go into designing a roller coaster that will be functional but still enjoyable for the rider.
837,An example is if the KE is the same as the hills PE the cart will not make it up.
627,For example when I had a drop height of 2 there was 1173J but with a drop height of 5 there was 2932J of energy.
823,E1R: The drop height of my roller coaster is 5.00 meters.
655,Because if we make the initial drop higher than the hill it will have more total energy and will use less than the total to make it over the hill.
329,In my trials 4.01m was the best hill height.
732,"At 5 meters the cart has the most potential energy at 2707 J, which means that it will have the most total energy on the ride at 2707 J."
728,We have decided to give the car a mass of 40 kg.
262,"As mentioned before and clearly highlighted here, there are many factors that go into creating the perfect roller coaster."
612,The potential energy is always going to be more than the Kinetic energy at the top of the initial drop.
662,This is because it will go the whole length without stopping and keeping the riders safe.
82,Examples of this are shown in my data.
611,E1: As we start our roller coaster to the height of 5 meters.
726,"The amount of mass the car has the more energy our evidence for this is in our mass and energy trials, in the data we can see that when the mass of the car was increased from 40kg to 50kg."
338,The car mass would be 60kg because the more mass you have the more speed you will have.
31,The greater the height the more potential energy.
413,The cart's PE at the top of the drop was 1566 and the KE at the bottom of the drop was 1952.
591,And the total energy was 1567 joules.
226,"At the top of the hill, the PE will only be 833, and the KE will rise to 1611."
370,The 4th test had 55 kg of mass and had the total energy of 2690.
264,E1R: There are many contributing factors and variables that go into designing a roller coaster that will be functional but still enjoyable for the rider.
505,"When you add your PE and KE together, it will always stay the same."
535,For example when the PE at the top of a coaster was 1564 joules the total energy of the coaster was 1564 joules.
640,Because of the height of our drop there is going to be more potential energy at the top of the coaster and the same amount of Kinetic energy going down from the drop.
450,"This is because at the bottom of the drop is when the car is moving the fastest, so the KE is the highest at that point."
407,I think it should be 3.00 because it is low enough that we have enough KE to get over the hill.
187,"For instance, when the car mass was 50 kg the PE and KE were both 2,443 J."
141,Something important to understand is the Law of Conservation of Energy.
488,This was the biggest mass I was able to test.
118,My team and I have discovered much about the physics of roller coasters in the past couple of days.
590,And the KE was 1565 joules at the bottom of the drop.
434,This does not effect how the energy gets transfered from PE to KE at all.
295,If there is no friction the energy shouldn't change into a different type.
599,"We have done some tests with mass we first tested a car with 40kg its PE was at 1763 then we tested a car at 60kg its PE was 2644 almost 1,000 differences in PE just because of mass."
172,I would start with a higher initial hill so the higher it is the more total energy it will have and then it will go faster and be able to clear the additional hill in front of it.
788,"This will happen because the potential energy turns into kinetic energy, which makes the car move."
30,"Potential energy is based on three things, one of them is height."
97,The car needs enough KE to go over the hill.
154,I would start with a higher initial hill so the higher it is the more total energy it will have and then it will go faster and be able to clear the additional hill in front of it.
361,I want the hills to be 40 meters because they are tall but not tall enough for the coaster to make it over.
564,"I know this because in trial 4 when the car had the greater mass of 60 kg, the amount of PE it had at the initial drop was 2350."
146,Assuming nothing else is different between the coasters a coaster car with a mass of 50kg will have more energy than a coaster car with a mass of 40kg and less energy than a coaster car with a mass of 60kg.
