107,"Overall, I think that the Gonzales family needs to make their initial drop higher than the hills and loops."
400,"Then when I tested a 5 meter drop, the potential energy at the top was 2688 Joules."
569,If the hill is the same height or higher than the initial drop then the car won't be able to go over because it won't have enough kinetic energy.
411,"I think this would make the ride fun and exciting because my data shows that a 50 KG cart has 2438 Joules of potential energy at the top of the initial drop, and 2435 Joules of kinetic energy at the bottom."
90,"For example in my data of Adding Hills, when the PE at the top of the initial drop was at 2449J, the amount of TE was 2449J."
441,The Gonzales family should use my roller coaster design because it meets the standards of the roller coaster they are looking for.
670,The PE at the top of the initial drop is the same as the total energy.
740,"Upon changing the drop height to 5 metres, the PE changed to 2443 J, a massive step up."
327,E1: dear Gonzales family
572,"However these tests were done without friction so some of the energy would transfer into thermal energy, so you would need a lower hill height and more momentum from the initial drop."
222,"We decided on an initial drop of 4.5m, because it allows enough energy for the cart while keeping the ride exciting."
376,The way my ride works is as you are about to board you are brought to the first drop of my ride.
300,"For a 3 m drop, the PE was 1466 J and KE was 0 J but at the bottom the PE was 1 J and the KE was 1465 J."
102,"Also, they should make sure the mass of the cart is at 60, so then there can be more TE."
346,E1: My Claim is that I can help the Gonzales family make a new and better roller coaster.
777,"This is because the cart will not have enough PE/total energy to make it across the entire track, and will instead get stuck at the hill."
467,The more mass the less the speed will be
796,"Then, when the drop was 5 meters, the potential energy was 2668 at the top and the kinetic energy was 2666 at the bottom."
86,"For example, in my data on Adding hills, when I set the hill height to 5.0 m and the initial drop to 5.0 m. The cart was not able to make it over the hill because there wasn't enough total energy, PE, and KE."
13,"If we wanted the hill to be pretty high, based on my data the cart mass would have to be high."
240,"For example, when we tested a car mass of 50kg, the total energy was 2201J."
79,This is so then there can be enough total energy to make it over the hills and around the loops.
373,Using one of my trials we can see that the less the cart weighs so lets say it weighs 40 kg then the amount of PE will be at 1958 J causing the cart to have less energy stored.
69,"For example, in my data on Adding hills, when I set the hill height to 5.0 m and the initial drop to 5.0 m. The cart was not able to make it over the hill because there wasn't enough total energy, PE, and KE."
699,"When we had a mass of 50 kilograms, the car had a total energy of 2449 joules."
367,E1R: My Claim is that I can help the Gonzales family make a new and better roller coaster.
571,But when the hill and initial drop were both 5 meters the car's KE at the top of the hill was 0 so it did not have enough energy to make it over.
127,This will help when considering hill height and the initial drop height.
151,"For example, when I tested the drop height at 2m the PE was 1173(J), but when I tested the height at 5m the PE was 2932(J)."
40,E1R: I think that the height of the initial drop should be 5 meters.
402,The total energy in a roller coaster is constantly being passed between kinetic and potential energy.
71,"So setting the height of the hills lower than the initial drop, will provide enough energy."
427,I think these recommendations will make for the best fun and safe roller coaster.
352,When you go down the hill you will see that the PE starts to transfer over the Kinetic because of it's motion.
716,That will eventually after the coaster hits the hill.
758,"First, we will understand how potential energy (PE) is a direct relationship with height."
137,"But when the hill height was 5m as well, the cart was not able to to make it over the hill."
814,"When I tested the drop height of 4 meters, the potential energy was 2445 joules."
470,"E1R: Dear Gonzales family,"
141,"For example, the initial drop height is set at 5 m, and the cart mass is 52 kg."
215,This shows that the energy is converted from KE and PE because no energy is added or subtracted.
439,"The mass of the cart which holds the riders, should be 50 kg."
139,"This is do to the total energy that is effected by the height of the initial drop, which means it only has enough total energy for going over hills that are smaller then the initial drop height, which in this case was 5 m. When it comes to mass, it has an effect on total energy as well."
96,"My data, it shows that when I set the height to 5.0 m. The amount of PE was 2449J, and the amount of TE was 2449J."
656,I look forward to making this roller coaster with you in the future.
3,"because of the PE being higher than the others, that means the car can go faster and keep the momentum so its safe and a blast to be on!."
333,if you are going to add a hill do it 3/4 up cause it has more pe energy and ke and you can't do it too high cause then it will just go back down the hill.
619,"my team has been working on this idea for a while now and we think you'll like it, it is called the Top Thrill Dragster."
394,I chose 50 kg to be safe to make sure it gets over and to make sure it dosent go to fast.
795,"When the initial drop was 2.5 meters, the potential energy was 1334 joules at the top and the kinetic energy at the bottom was 1334."
844,E1R: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 3 meters.
545,PE and KE change as they go down the drop.
623,"Even though PE and KE might change, this does not effect the total energy."
185,"For example, in trial number 2 the amount of KE is 0, the amount of PE is 1466 and the TE is 1466."
39,"With friction, the kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop would not be as close to the potential energy at the top of the drop because some of the energy would turn into a non-mechanical kind of energy like thermal energy."
423,"My data shows that a 50 KG cart has 2438 Joules of potential energy at the top of the initial drop, and 2435 Joules of kinetic energy at the bottom."
727,"In my following experiments, we kept the height the same(5 meters) and the hill height the same(3 meters) and increased the mass of the car."
577,E1: Dear Gonzales family here are my recommendations for you to make the best roller coaster possible for your park.
58,Putting the hill height at 3 m will make it so the car will not stop before it is supposed to but will also be fun and fast.
219,"In conclusion, the roller coaster should have an initial drop higher than the hill, and the mass of the roller coaster should depend on how much energy you want the ride to have."
99,"Also, when I set the hill height to 4.75 m. There was enough total energy to make it over the hill when the initial drop height was 5 meters."
438,"If the Gonzales family added the 3.00 m hill, the ride would be more fun, but still make it to the end of the ride."
450,"E1: Dear Gonzales family,"
550,"Odviously, the TE energy decreased because some of it converted to mechanical energy and became useless energy."
789,"If our cart is 40 kilograms, it would glide through the track but not really gather a lot of potential energy due to its lightweight."
444,"For example, In Trial 1, when the drop was 5.00 m, the total amount of energy was 2443 J."
702,"When we dropped the car from 3 meters, there were 1,466 joules of PE at the top and 1465 joules of KE at the bottom."
320,"Also at the top, the KE has a smaller number but at the bottom it has a larger number."
759,A direct relationship is where one variable increases/decreases with the second variable.
834,"The height relates to the KE because at the bottom of the initial drop, since the height was 3 meters the KE is going to be a lot larger than the PE."
82,"This is because if the initial drop is higher than the hills and loops, there will be more total energy to go over the hills and loops."
446,"In Trial 3, when the hill height was 5.00 m, the coaster car did not make it over the hill."
63,"All of these trials were conducted without friction, but I know that there would be friction in the real world."
827,E1R: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
331,and if you did it too small there would be no speed no energy it would not be fun.
49,"In an ideal situation where the bottom of the drop is flush with the ground, the kinetic energy at the bottom would be equal to the total energy."
315,Mass also effects PE and KE.
847,"Depending on how much mass the cart has, at the initial drop the potential energy goes up."
7,with a smaller hill height the more momentum and the higher we can make the next hill because of all the PE to keep going.
563,For example when the initial drop height was 3 meters the PE at the top was 1173 joules and 1173 joules of KE at the bottom.
111,"E1: When building this roller coaster, you will need to consider the initial drop height, the hills height and the mass of the cart."
642,Once through the loop the magnets will help us get to the top of the hill then when we are at the top there is a spot for people to get of if they don't wish to continue.
618,"E1: My proposal is this, you allow my team to give you an idea that could save your business and open a new attraction to your park."
290,The 1 J of energy went into the air.
640,This kinetic energy should help us get through the loop.
409,This means it has enough potential energy to keep moving after the hill.
202,"E1R: Dear Gonzales Family, I propose that the total amount of energy at the bottom and top of the initial drop should be the same but the KE and PE should be different."
347,In order to make a new and exciting roller coaster we needed to know how to make a collar coaster and all the parts that go into making a roller coaster.
785,What takes more effort to push?
700,"This shows that the more mass the car has, the more exciting the ride will be, since the energy it has will make the car go faster."
778,"Since we need our passengers to make it across the hill, we needed to simply make the hill height smaller every single time."
54,I think the best hill height would be 3 meters.
561,Thats why the total energy is smaller at the bottom of rides rather than at top.
264,"But when we used 4.5m for the drop, the total energy went up to 2199J."
72,"And to have more total energy to get over things, the initial drop needs to be higher than the hills and loops."
359,One last thing we needed to know was the mass and the relationship it has with PE and KE.
167,Then there is a down hill and a corkscrew with very small bumps at the end.
351,When you start at the top of a hill you will see that all of the potential energy is stored into that object.
554,"But when I had a drop height of 4 and hill height of 5, the cart didn't make it through the ride."
845,The energy transformation changed when the height of the roller coaster was higher or lower.
33,Putting the hill height at 3 m will make it so the car will not stop before it is supposed to but will also be fun and fast.
482,In the next simulation we did we learned about the mass and energy of the coaster car.
166,"After that loop there is another loop that is 250m tall, so again it should make it past there."
286,"For example, the TE and PE at a 3 meter release height were both 1466 J."
466,This coaster car had the least potential energy with 1958 J of energy.
103,Which will provide a faster and more fun ride.
630,"Even though PE and KE might change, this does not affect the total energy."
208,"This is true because the total amount of energy in trial 2 begins at 1959 J and ends at 1959 J, while the energy is transformed from PE to KE."
97,"But when the cart went to the bottom of the hill, the KE was 2445J and the PE was 4J, but the amount of TE was still 2449J."
683,"When we dropped the car from 3 meters, there were 1466 joules of PE at the top and 1465 joules of KE at the bottom."
87,"The PE at the top was at 2449J, which isn't enough potential energy to make it over the hill."
615,This means that it must be transferred to another energy source just like kinetic energy to potential energy which equals the total energy.
747,"Looking back on the final KE, we can notice it simply doesn't have enough to continue moving up the hill, it can only fall back down."
610,The mass of your cart will effect your coasters potential energy and kinetic energy because the cart is much harder to transfer as it is a much heavier object.
500,i tested this stuff without friction obviously that's not possible in the real world.
76,Still having it be fun and safe.
173,"For example, a hill height of 5000m needs 7000(J) to make it over, but the initial drop height of 4500m only gives 4750(J) it will not be able to get over."
255,"First of all, to make the ride exciting, as I mentioned before, we need as much total energy as possible."
429,"It is exciting, and the cart makes it to the end of the ride."
332,"in the middle height, you just won't have enough energy as the highest one."
805,E1R: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 250 meters.
171,"For example, when I tested the drop height at 2m the PE was 1173(J), but when I tested the height at 5m the PE was 2932(J)."
289,"For example, at a 4 m release height the PE was 1955 J of energy and while the car went down the drop the PE turned into KE so the KE was now 2442 J of energy."
306,E1: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
559,"The relationship between PE and KE is that when the cart is on the top of the hill, the KE is always 0, but when the cart is at the bottom, the PE is always 0."
234,"Once the car starts moving, the kinetic energy goes up and potential energy goes down."
784,To put it in a simpler way: imagine you are pushing a boulder and a rock.
823,It was still able to get over the hill.
428,E1: The Gonzales family should use my roller coaster design because it meets the criteria they are looking for.
38,"All of these trials were conducted without friction, but I know that there would be friction in the real world."
192,"For example in trial number 3 when the drop height and hill height are the same, the car doesn't have enough energy to make it over the hill."
230,"At the top of the initial drop, there is only potential energy, and no kinetic."
345,you want to make it as heavy as you can cause that has the most energy pe and ke and total that will bring you the most.
378,As you the rider gets through the intial drop and going down you will hit the first hill.
633,"The roller coaster design I have come up with will be a great addition to the park as my roller coaster is long, scary, exciting, has tons of inversions, a huge hill, a corkscrew, and rings of fire."
235,"For example, in our first trial we used an initial drop height of 3m, this gave us 1466J of energy to work with."
419,This proves that the total energy is equal to the sum of the kinetic and potential energy.
551,Thats why TE energy is smaller at the bottom of rides rather than at top.
475,"For example, the release height of 2.00 had less potential energy (977 J) and the release height of 5.00 meters had 2443 J of potential energy at the top of the initial drop."
634,The coaster will be made from titanium and the cart will be made from wood and weigh around 60kg.
356,On the drop the potential energy is the total energy and then decreases towards the bottom but on the top of the hill the potential energy and the kinetic energy equals the total energy.
284,"Next, the TE and PE at the top of the Initial drop will be the same."
790,"If we had a cart that is 60 kilograms, it would have a slower start but gather more energy at the top of the hill."
524,I recommend we use a mass of 55.
489,Then when it makes it way down it changes into kinetic energy to continue on with the ride.
395,This is what ive learned about my coaster.
316,The more mass something has the slower it will go down the hill.
462,"The coaster car didnt have enough energy to make it over the hill and to the end, but.. the height of 3.70 meters had enough potential energy and kinetic energy to make it over the hill and then end of the track."
130,Lets talk about the initial drop height first.
145,E1: You should use my roller coaster recommendation because it has the appropriate initial drop height in order for the coaster car to make it to the end of the ride.
292,"This is because, the more mass you have the slower your car will go."
295,E1R: The drop height of my roller coaster will be 5 meters high.
8,with all of this combined i think we will make a great coaster.
386,When the car was going up the hill all of its KE was converted to PE and the car was stuck and had no motion.
635,We will drop from a world record height of 500 feet through a loop with a hole in it.
680,E1: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 4 meters.
591,In my simulation when I set it to 5 meters off the ground drop the cart had 2932 joules of potential energy at the top and 2931 joules of potential energy it more likely that more kinetic energy.
671,The KE at the bottom is super close to the PE at the top of the hill.
786,The boulder!
692,I think that the hill should be 3 meters.
180,But when I had a car that was 60kg it had a PE of 2973(J).
285,This is because PE is stored in an object.
57,"However, when the hill height was 3 m, it did reach the end."
56,"For example, when the height of the hill is equal to the height of the initial drop, which in this case is 5 m, the car did not reach the end."
91,"But when it was at the bottom of the drop, the amount of KE was 2445J."
690,"The total energy, however, didn't change at all."
737,"This is because the amount of Potential Energy (PE) is related to height, and it's a direct relationship."
83,"But if there isn't enough total energy, the cart will not make it over the hills."
15,With a smaller hill height the more momentum and the higher we can make the next hill because of all the PE to keep going.
271,That's it for now!
472,"We have learned all about potential energy, kinetic energy, total energy, car energy/mass, initial drops, hills, etc."
560,"Odviously, the total energy decreased because some of it converted to mechanical energy and became useless energy."
340,E1R: dear Gonzales family
471,During the roller coaster and energy analysis.
775,"However, 4 metres or more isn't the only reason we lower the drop height under 4 metres."
771,"Calling back to our PE/KE relationship, the energy is still there and is being converted when moving down or up hills or loops."
104,"For example, in my data of Mass & Energy, when I set the cart weight to 60 kg, there was 2936J TE."
770,"This is because the mechanical energy, potential and kinetic, are being converted to non-mechanical energy: thermal, sound, etc."
825,Meaning that if a 50 kg roller coaster at the top of the drop and hill will have more potential energy.
518,So i recommend the hill height be 4.
100,"This shows that even making the slightest change, can stay provide enough energy to make over the hill."
32,"However, when the hill height was 3 m, it did reach the end."
598,In my model to stop the cart we have one hill at the end that doesnt go back down and so the cart goes up and loses all its potential energy and comes to a stop.
433,"As the ride ended, the potential energy at the bottom of the drop was 2443 J, and the Potential energy at the bottom was 0 J."
474,"I also noticed throughout the simulation that the potential energy also is the same number as the total energy, The total energy is all the energy that the rollercoaster can reach."
638,At the top of the hill there will be tons of potential energy since its very high up and the cart is very heavy.
310,increased at 2166 Joules.
365,All these things go into making a roller coaster.
483,"During the simulation, I tested a small mass, 2 medium masses, and 1 heavy mass of a coaster car."
176,I would also recommend a car with a big mass.
757,Here's how we came to this height.
420,"So the roller coaster never loses any of it's total energy, it is simply passed between kinetic and potential energy."
538,I recommend we use a mass of 60.
283,"For example, the PE at the top of a 2 meters drop height is 977 J while the PE at the top of a 4 meter drop is 1955 J."
10,"However, that sounds like a blast; it wouldn't be safe for our riders."
696,I think that the mass of the car should be 50 kilograms.
530,So the total energy will stay the same but the energy with convert from PE to KE and the other way around.
457,For example the release height of 2.00 had less potential energy (977 J) and the release height of 5.00 meters had 2443 J of potential energy at the top of the initial drop.
831,E1: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 3 meters.
384,I made this drop so the KE would have enough J of energy to get over the hill.
105,"But when I set the cart weight to 40 kg, there was only 1957J TE."
385,see I did this because in one of my expiremnts I made my hill to big (5.00 m).
368,In order to make a new and exciting roller coaster we needed to know how to make a roller coaster and all the parts that go into making a roller coaster.
269,"When we went up to 60kg, the total energy also went up to 2641J."
261,"For both the initial drop & hill, the greater the height, the more energy."
788,This can also be defined as inertia.
116,This is the process.
548,I know this because at the bottom of the initial drop the PE was 0 and KE was 650.
299,"For example, My PE for the initial drop height of 5 m was 2443 J and the KE was 0 J but as the cart moved towards the bottom, the end result was a PE of 1 J and KE of 2442 J."
773,"The reason we picked 4 metres for our initial drop height is that a hill height of 4 metres or more is pretty dang tall, and we feel like it couldn't be very safe for a high hill height."
37,"The car will move faster and therefore be more exciting with 50 kg than 40 kg, but not be too heavy to not be able to make it over hills."
244,Let us know if you have any changes or recommendations.
684,"This shows that the higher up the initial drop starts, the more total energy there will be."
236,"But when we used 4.5m for the drop, the total energy went up to 2199J."
342,And a lot of ke at the bottom my studies show that in the data the hier one had more energy 2443 energy for the highest and 977 for the lowest more total energy in my studies the tallest was the best.
200,This shows that the mass of the rollercoaster car affects how much total energy there is.
95,The amount of PE just transferred into KE.
461,"For example, I did the hill height as 5.00 meters with the initial drop height always being 5.00 meters as well."
113,Lets talk about the initial drop height first.
478,If the hill was higher or the same as the drop the coaster car would not make it over.
85,The Gonzales family needs to make the initial drop higher than the hills and loops so then there is enough total energy to go over the hill and around the loop.
410,My final recommendation is to have a cart wight a mass of 50 KG.
430,"The Gonzales family should have a roller coaster with a drop height of 5.00 m, because it will increase the amount of potential energy that is used to get the cart to the end without stopping."
250,"According to our data, using these heights gets us the most total energy, 2203 J."
19,"For example, when the initial drop height was 3 m, the potential energy at the top of the initial drop was 1466 J."
318,The height of the drop also effects PE and KE.
687,"Because PE is reliant on height, the PE went down as the car moved down."
109,"So then everybody who rides the ride will have a fun, enjoyable, exciting, and safe experience."
711,"At the start, PE was 2443, and going through the roller coaster, the end it was at the end it was 1."
148,Then there is a down hill and a corkscrew with very small bumps at the end.
594,E1: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
631,"And that concludes this proposal, I hope you take it into consideration, best of luck."
42,"For example, when the initial drop height was 3 m, the potential energy at the top of the initial drop was 1466 J."
1,If the hill height is taller than the initial drop it would not make it to the end and it would be unsafe to our riders.
840,If the cart was in the middle of the initial drop and the bottom of the initial drop then the energy would transfer from more PE to more KE.
330,And a lot of ke at the bottom and more total energy in my studies the tallest was the best.
531,Total energy will stay the same without friction.
768,"LCE states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, so we cannot get rid of or gain random energy."
644,Once at the bottom it will go through a loop into a cork screw and go under ground through to inversions to where magnets bring it to a stop.
391,"See I tested three cars will three different masses 40 kg,50 kg and 60 kg."
31,"For example, when the height of the hill is equal to the height of the initial drop, which in this case is 5 m, the car did not reach the end."
77,"Also they should make sure the mass of the cart is at 50, so then there won't be any problems with having a heavy cart."
147,"After that loop there is another loop that is 250m tall, so again it should make it past there."
588,So of you apply all of this to your roller coasters it will surely be fun and safe for everyone.
307,This is because the height was the largest it could be and the energy gave it enough momentum to go all the way down the hill.
110,"Also, they need to make the cart weigh 60 kg so then there is more TE, which will provide a faster and more fun roller coaster."
241,"When we went up to 60kg, the total energy also went up to 2641J."
756,E1R: Our team's initial drop height will be 4 metres.
396,"E1R: My teams roller coaster will be one of the most succsessful coasters in the whole park because, not only is it fun and thrilling, it has the science behind it to help make this ride a thrill."
22,"When the release height was 3 m, the kinetic energy at the bottom was 1465 J, while when the release height was 5 m, the kinetic energy at the bottom was 2442 J."
364,"The last thing you need to know is the relationship between potential , kinetic and mass."
492,I think this because if the hill is super high then that means we have a greater PE.
184,"E1: Dear Gonzales Family, I propose that the total amount of energy at the bottom and top of the initial drop should be the same but the KE and PE should be different."
435,They should also add a hill in order for it to be more fun for the riders.
564,However when the drop height was 5 meters the PE at the top was 1957 joules at the top and 1957 joules of KE at the bottom.
766,"This means that during whatever point of the roller coaster, start, middle or end, KE + PE always equals total energy."
553,"I know this because when I had a drop height of 4 and hill height of 3.5, the cart made it through the whole ride."
523,So having a higher mass will help the car go faster on the hill and around the loop making it more exiting.
60,"For example, when the mass of the car is 50 kg, the potential energy is 2444 J at the top of the initial drop and 2436 J of kinetic energy at the bottom."
260,This supports the idea that the initial drop height should be as high as possible.
848,But if the mass is less the potential energy goes down.
706,"When we had a mass of 50 kilograms, the car had a total energy of 2,449 joules."
136,"For example, in the data we collected, when the initial drop height was 5 m and the hill height was 3.50 m, the cart was able to go over the hill with ease."
520,The mass can also effect the total energy.
590,In my simulation the cart that was on the initial drop (4.05m) that was lower than the hill afterwards (5.02) didn't make it over the hill.
447,"In Trial 2, when the hill height was 2.00 m, the coaster car made it to the end of the ride, because the hill height was not taller than the initial drop height."
612,"For example when I tested the drop height of 4 meters, the PE didnt have enough joules to make it over our hill."
436,The trials showed that a hill height of 3.00 m would have a total energy of 2466 J.
382,"This was proven in my expirement (intial drop) there was 2443 J of PE at the top of the drop, at the bottom of my drop the PE was at 1 J and the PE was at 2442."
802,"Although, in the real world (simulation excludes this part for accurate data), some of the energy will change into other forms like heat, sound, etc."
398,"This would lead to more potential energy before it drops, and therefore more kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop."
193,This is because it doesn't have the extra energy from the initial drop because it already used it up trying to get over the hill that is the same height.
159,When I had a car that had a mass of 40kg it only had 1958(J) at the top of the initial drop.
803,"so the potential energy at the top, and the kinetic energy at the bottom wouldn't be equal."
730,When I added friction to my carts I noticed that my potential and kinetic energy was no longer the same.
245,"E1R: Dear Gonzales family, your roller coaster is in great progress."
779,Our initial drop height was 5 during one test and our hill height was the same.
733,"The weight of the cart should be 60kg because it will have more energy, and the hill should be smaller than the original drop."
838,"But when we added friction the PE at the top while it was moving was less without friction, and vise versa for KE."
780,Our cart had 12 J of kinetic energy before falling back down.
182,Also you need to have enough energy to get to the end of the track so you want to have a high initial drop and a big car mass to give it the most TE possible.
181,So if you want the ride to be safe you need to have the hill height shorter than the initial drop height.
810,"This is possible because (in a friction less environment) potential energy could go up, and kinetic energy could go down, but the total energy will always stay the same."
23,Having an initial drop height of 5 m will make this ride more fun and exciting.
228,"That's all for the updates, but we want to bring up a few key points."
689,"As the PE went down, the KE went up."
16,With all of this combined I think we will make a great coaster that will be safe and enjoyable to all riders!
34,The best mass of the car would be 50 kg.
580,Second the higher the initial drop the better.
224,"According to our data, a hill height of 4m is the perfect combination of safety & fun."
534,The higher the height the more PE the coaster will have.
456,I also noticed throughout the simulation that the potential energy also is the same number as the total energy.
328,I think you should have a high hill the highest you can.
832,"This is because our loops, hills, and turns need enough speed from the initial drop to get to the end of the coaster."
362,These things that I have told you about are all things we are going to need in order to make a new and exciting roller coaster.
201,"In conclusion, the roller coaster should have an initial drop higher than the hill, and the mass of the roller coaster should depend on how much energy you want the ride to have."
161,So if you want the ride to be safe you need to have the hill height shorter than the initial drop height.
528,So we need to make sure we start with enough total energy to make it to the end.
379,This hill is 2.50 m tall.
144,This will help when considering hill height and the initial drop height.
418,"At the bottom of that drop, there were 2687 Joules of kinetic energy, and 1 Joule of potential."
229,"First of all, to make the ride exciting, as I mentioned before, we need as much total energy as possible."
73,"This proves that the Gonzales family needs to make sure that their initial drop is higher than the hills, so then there is enough total energy to go over the hill."
719,E1R: The drop height is five meters.
301,"Next, the TE remains constant and equal to its PE."
372,It can only transform from one form to another.An energy transformation is the change of energy from one form to another.
21,A similar thing happens to the kinetic energy at the bottom of the initial drop.
539,E1: The drop heigh of my roller coaster design is 4 meters.
339,than if it had a lower ke.
648,"As my roller coaster is long, scary, exciting, and has tons of inversions, a huge hill, and a corkscrew."
811,E1: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
253,"When we used a car mass of 60kg, the total energy went up to 2641."
490,This shows that the energy changes but it is never destroyed.
798,"As you can see from the data above, when the height is the same the potential energy at the top, and the kinetic energy at the bottom are equal."
421,This is another reason why an initial drop height of 5 meters would be most beneficial to our roller coaster.
118,"When you want to add a hill, you need to be aware of how tall it will be, or the cart might not be able to get over."
238,This is true for every trial.
397,E1: My first recommendation for this roller coaster would be to have an initial drop height of 5 meters.
568,Also if the initial drop height is higher than it can make it over the hill.
511,But when i tested the height of 3 the total energy was 1466.
616,Total energy you can see/know even before the energy trasffers because the starting potential energy is the same as the total energy and same with the ending kinetic energy.
480,The coaster car didn't have enough energy to make it over the hill and to the end.
6,The mass and energy data with the PE and KE were very similar and I think that will help our ride be fun and safe.
59,The best mass of the car would be 50 kg.
452,We have also done multiple different simulations to advance our learning in these categories.
602,kinetic energy is when the potential energy is transferred as it goes down the hill so that the kinetic energy can push it back up or bring it to a slow stop.
589,E1R: Dear Gonzales family here are my recommendations for you to make the best roller coaster possible for your park.
20,"However, when the initial drop height was 5 m, the potential energy was 2443 J at the top of the initial drop."
62,"The car will move faster and therefore be more exciting with 50 kg than 40 kg, but not be too heavy to not be able to make it over hills."
821,My drop height was 5 meters and my hill height was 3.5 meters.
774,Anything lower than 4 metres seems more or less safe and enjoyable for our passengers.
4,"The PE of the car at the top of the initial drop was 2,445 J because it hadn't moved yet, and the PE at the bottom was 2,444 J because it had moved."
503,I think this because then we can add a hill whatever size below it.
463,The next simulation we did we learned about the mass and energy of the coaster car.
415,E1R: My first recommendation for this roller coaster would be to have an initial drop height of 5 meters.
375,"E1: My teams roller coaster will be one of the most succsessful coasters in the whole park because, not only is it fun and thrilling, it has the science behind it to help make this ride a thrill."
555,"Lastly, the relationship between mass, PE and KE!"
377,"This drop is (in my model) 5.00 m tall, in my research when my intial drop height was 5.00 m tall it produced 2443 J of PE before the drop."
464,"During the simulation, I tested a small mass, 2 medium masses, and 1 heavy mass."
304,This is because PE is stored energy.
35,"For example, when the mass of the car is 50 kg, the potential energy is 2444 J at the top of the initial drop and 2436 J of kinetic energy at the bottom."
662,the mass of the car affects the PE because the PE=mass x height x acceleration due to gravity(9.8 m/s/s).
349,Potential energy is energy that is stored in an object and Kinetic energy is the energy an object has because of its motion.
64,"With friction, the kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop would not be as close to the potential energy at the top of the drop because some of the energy would turn into a non-mechanical kind of energy like thermal energy."
308,"For example, when I tested the drop height of 3 meters, the PE was 1624 Joules."
46,Having an initial drop height of 5 m will make this ride more fun and exciting.
205,"At the bottom of this same ride, the PE is at 1 and the KE is at 1465 J, when added they equal 1466 J."
319,"At the top, the PE has the largest number but at the bottom it has a smaller number."
841,Some similarities I observed with the initial drop height and hill height was the same thing but with smaller numbers.
232,This supports the idea that the initial drop height should be as high as possible.
712,"Going down that drastically, shows how the mass is light, and how it would make the roller coaster fast."
536,Otherwise there will not be enough energy and it wont make it over the hill.
257,A high initial drop also means more potential energy.
714,"The five works better to for the lop, because when the lop goes down we can make the hill pretty high because of the power of it going down."
502,E1R: My recommendation is to start with the initial drop at 5 ft.
820,It turned out that energy was just getting converted into thermal/heat energy and no energy had been destroyed.
720,"The relationship between PE and KE is As the cars go to the next hill, some kinetic energy is transformed into the potential energy."
84,They also need to make the cart weigh 60 kg so then there will be more TE.
676,E1R: The drop height is going to be 5 because that will give it enough energy to make it over the hill.
223,"As for the hill after the drop, we plan on making the height as high as possible."
501,but in the real world the PE would be high but then when it got to the bottom and it formed into KE there would be less KE then there was PE at the initial drop.
214,"When the roller coaster car reaches the top of the hill it doesn't come to a complete stop the PE is 1228 J and the KE is 727 J, the total energy stays the same."
408,"But when we tested a hill height of 4 meters, the cart made it over the hill with 1964 Joules of potential energy at the top."
256,"At the top of the initial drop, there is only potential energy, and no kinetic."
533,The energy will change when it is going down the drop the PE will be less but now it is going faster so KE will go up.
549,This allows me to talk about energy transformation and Law of Conversation of Energy.
197,This shows that the energy is converted from KE and PE because no energy is added or subtracted.
701,E1R: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 4 meters.
521,For example when i tested the mass of 40 kg the total energy was 1956.
305,"Next, while the car is moving down the drop, the PE will transform into KE."
514,The Law of conservation and energy states that energy can be created or destroyed but it can convert to other types of energy.
682,"For example, when we dropped the coaster from 2 meters, there was 977 joules of potential energy at the top, and 976 joules of KE at the bottom."
129,All of these play a part in the cart making it to the end of the ride with out it needing to stop or fall back and try to restart.
653,When the cart reaches the bottom of the drop it has tons of kinetic energy.
92,"And the amount of PE was at 4, but the amount of total energy was at 2449J still."
726,This drop was very important to note because if there isn't enough potential energy the roller coaster won't be able to go over the hills and loops effectively.
819,So when it seemed that some of the energy was disappearing.
152,When the car goes up the loop it will need enough energy to make it over.
601,The only time you can have potential energy is when the cart is above surface level.
636,Then we will get pulled up 600 feet by magnets to a drop down into a loop that leads into a corkscrew and into under ground where you go upside down twice before coming to a stop.
792,"Mass is a very important factor when it comes to energy, and is crucial when designing a roller coaster."
280,E1: The drop height of my roller coaster will be 5 meters high.
725,"During my experiments, I saw that when the height was set to 5 meters the Potential energy was 2443j but when I dropped the height to 4 meters the Potential energy went down to 1955j."
542,"When I increased the drop height to 4 meters, the PE increased at 1466 Joules."
762,"However, there's also a relationship between PE and kinetic energy (KE)."
765,"Potential Energy at the very beginning of the coaster defines total energy, and kinetic energy at the end of the roller coaster defines total energy."
9,"E1R: Hello, Mr. Gonzales."
657,E1: I want my car to start at 5 meters.
45,"When the release height was 3 m, the kinetic energy at the bottom was 1465 J, while when the release height was 5 m, the kinetic energy at the bottom was 2442 J."
179,When I had a car that had a mass of 40kg it only had 1958(J) at the top of the initial drop.
337,the smaller it is the least the energy the bigger it is the more the energy.
399,"I know this because when I tested a 4 meter drop, it had a potential energy of 2150 Joules at the top."
596,"For example when I tested the drop height of 4 meters, the PE didnt have en\d had enough energy to make it over the hill."
815,But when I increased the drop height to 5 meters the the potential energy was 2446 joules.
481,Unlike the height of 3.70 meters had enough potential and kinetic energy to make it over the hill and then to the end of the track.
75,"This shows that even making the slightest change, can stay provide enough energy to make over the hill."
142,The total energy was 2524 J.
583,Law of conservation of energy
557,"I know this because when I had a car mass of 50, the total energy was 2447, but when I had a car mass of 60, the TE was 2936."
546,The energy at the initial drop is always higher than at the bottom.
348,One thing that goes into making a roller coaster is the potential and Kinetic energy.
708,"My group decided on this specific height because we think going the highest even though it could be risky, we figured out with a specific amount of mass,add a lop instead of the hill first."
393,I belive this is because as the car has a higher mass it makes the car more dense this making the weight of gravity pull down on it causing more energy.
195,This happens in trial number 2 which states the PE at the top of the initial drop is 1958 and the KE is 0.
353,Another thing we needed to know about making a new roller coaster is how we are able to finish the entire ride with just one initial drop.
732,"In conclusion, the drop height should be 5 meters so the cart will be able to go over the hills and loop more efficiently."
469,"I have learned that Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can change."
767,"To understand why we don't lose or gain energy, we have to understand the Law of Conservation of Energy (LCE)."
48,This is because the car is not moving- kinetic energy comes from motion.
679,If the initial drop is not big enough then the cart wont make it over the hill but if the hill height is to big the cart also wont make it over the hill.
405,Another recommendation I have is to have a hill height of 4 meters.
263,"For example, in our first trial we used an initial drop height of 3m, this gave us 1466J of energy to work with."
459,The second simulation we did deal with adding a hill to the initial drop.
722,This relates to total energy because total energy is PE together when PE and KE combine!
187,"At the bottom of this same ride, the PE is at 1 and the KE is at 1465, when added they equal 1466."
783,Mass affects energy in one simple way.
595,This is because the cart will need to have enough potential energy to make it over the hill.
753,"At the bottom of the drop, KE is, instead, TE, and PE is 0."
190,"This is true because the total amount of energy in trial 2 stays the same the whole time, while the energy is transformed from PE to KE."
650,We will drop from a world-record height of 600 feet.
455,The higher the potential energy at the top of the initial drop the more kinetic energy the coaster car had at the bottom.
426,This shows that more mass means that there will be more total energy.
707,E1: The drop height is five meters.
158,"And because the PE is the greatest, the TE will also be the greatest."
713,"Meanwhile with are second choice being four, it starts at 1955 and ends at 1835, making it slow, and boring."
120,"But when the hill height was 5m as well, the cart was not able to to make it over the hill."
183,"Also if you want the ride to be fun, you will want a high drop height and a lot of energy."
321,E1R: The initial drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
519,The mass of the car is also very important.
584,that energy can neither be created nor destroyed.
122,"This is do to the total energy that is effected by the height of the initial drop, which mean it only has enough total energy for going over hills that are smaller then the initial drop height, which in this case was 5 m. When it comes to mass, it has an effect on total energy as well."
485,"Compared to the car with the least mass, in this case, 40kg."
425,A 45 KG cart had only had 2183 Joules of potential energy at the top of the drop.
370,The less your cart weighs the less energy your cart will have stored.
387,All of my stored up PE started to convert back to KE as the car started to roll back down the hill.
338,pe is energy that turns into ke and it will make the cart go faster.
525,All of this was tested in a friction less scenario.
156,I would also recommend a car with a big mass.
243,That's it for now!
268,"For example, when we tested a car mass of 50kg, the total energy was 2201J."
573,"Nonetheless the total energy stays the same and the same rules apply, such as the hill height needing to be lower than the initial drop height."
424,This means that the kart also has enough kinetic energy to get over the hill.
329,cause it has more potential energy at the top.
544,This amount may decrease by the end of the ride due to the mechanical energy that absorbs some of the TE.
647,the roller coaster design I have come up with will be a great addition to the park.
632,"E1: Dear, Gonzales family"
705,"When we had a car with a mass of 40 kilograms, it had a total energy of 1,958 joules."
694,"Whenever we made the hill as tall or higher than the initial drop, there wasn't enough energy for the car to make it to the end of the ride."
782,"To conclude my message, let's finally talk about mass and energy."
835,"For example, when I tested the drop height of 3 meters, the PE was 1446 joules."
160,But when I had a car that was 60kg it had a PE of 2973(J).
527,Thermal and sound energy wont be used so the total energy will go down.
664,E1R: I want my car to start at 5 meters.
641,we will get over the jump in the loop using magnets to keep the cart at a precise spot so there are no fatality's.
302,"For example, with release height of 2 m the TE is 977 J and PE is also 977 J."
448,"When the cart had a mass of 40 kg, the total amount of energy was lower."
68,The Gonzales family needs to make the initial drop higher than the hills and loops so then there is enough total energy to go over the hill and around the loop.
296,"Next, there is a inverse relationship between PE and KE."
164,E1R: You should use my roller coaster recommendation because it has the appropriate initial drop height in order for the coaster car to make it to the end of the ride.
769,"In an environment that has friction, it may seem like we are losing energy."
611,E1R: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
247,"We decided on an initial drop of 4.5m, because it allows enough energy for the cart while keeping the ride exciting."
772,Now let's look at initial drop height and hill height relationships.
576,"This also proves that the PE and KE are inversely related, meaning when one goes up the other goes down."
839,The energy transformation changed when the height of the roller coaster changed.
126,"Then the cart weight was put at 56 kg, and now the total energy is 2740."
808,"In addition, when the mass increases, potential, kinetic, and total energy will all increase."
507,Then there will be more speed and more TE.
822,So even with friction acting on my roller coaster.
389,There is one last thing I had to make sure to mention is the mass of my car.
355,If you have a drop of 5.00 m and a hill of 5.00 m you aren't going to make it all the way because there isn't enough energy stored.
66,"This is because if the initial drop is higher than the hills and loops, there will be more total energy to go over the hills and loops."
579,In my simulation the cart that was on the initial drop that was lower than the hill afterwards didn't make it over the hill.
718,I hoped this helped your understanding of roller coasters!
143,"Then the cart weight was put at 56 kg, changing the total energy to 2740."
237,"This proves that the greater height, the more energy."
651,"At the top of the initial drop, there will be a large number of total energy all of which is potential energy because of how high it is and because of how much the cart weighs."
731,This was because the friction changed into an external source of energy that can no longer be used.
695,"If we make the hill smaller than the initial drop, then the car will have enough energy to make it to the end of the ride."
688,"However, because energy cannot be created or destroyed, all that energy got converted into KE."
488,"At first, the rollercoaster has all potential energy and no kinetic before going down the initial drop."
413,It also means that the cart will be moving fast and also safely.
609,once you make it to the hill you will have partial kinetic energy and partial potential energy because it wont be high enough to equal the total energy.
196,"When the rollercoaster car reaches the top of the hill it doesn't come to a complete stop the PE is 1228 and the KE is 727, the total energy stays the same."
227,"Keep in mind, the final design may vary from these plans after more trials & testing."
314,At the top the KE is low and at the bottom the KE is high because the PE has turned into KE.
404,So having more potential energy at the top of the initial drop will allow the cart to move quickly and efficiently throughout the coaster.
793,E1: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 250 meters.
218,This shows that the mass of the roller coaster car affects how much total energy there is.
417,"My data shows that on a 5 meter hill, the total energy was 2688 Joules, and the potential energy at the top of the drop was also 2688 Joules."
175,"When I did the test I saw that when the initial drop height was 5m and the hill was 5m the car did not make it over, but when the hill height was 4m the car did make it over."
537,So I recommend the hill height be 4.
755,It's crucial to know that since it could ruin the entire ride if the cart can't make it over a section.
262,"Once the car starts moving, the kinetic energy goes up and potential energy goes down."
468,"During these simulations, with the law of conservation of energy.."
343,and if you did it too small there would be no speed no energy cause the highest was 2446 and the lowest one was 244 the middle was 2447. it would not be fun.
312,So when the energy at the top for PE is high and the PE at the bottom is low I know that the PE turned into both thermal energy and KE.
698,"When we had a car with a mass of 40 kilograms, it had a total energy of 1958 joules."
146,"Because I will have the initial drop height at 400m and the first loop at 300m, that car will be able to make it past that loop."
153,"For example, a hill height of 5000m needs 7000(J) to make it over, but the initial drop height of 4500m only gives 4750(J) it will not be able to get over."
586,Third make the cart heavy.
374,Now lets say that it weighs 60 kg then the amount of PE will be larger at 2937 J.
491,E1: My recommendation is to start with the height at 5 ft.
505,For example if the hill is 5 ft we have a 2443 PE at the top of the hill.
303,"For a 5 m drop, the TE is 2443 J and the PE is 2443 J."
799,This is because of the Law of Conservation of Energy.
760,"This means if our height is 4 metres, our PE will be 1955 joules (J), and if our height is 5 metres, our PE is 2443 J."
621,"Our starting height of 4.5 m and car mass of 52 kg will always make it to the end of the ride with a hill in the middle of 4.25 m. With this height and mass, our ride starts with 2298 joules of PE, that changes to KE when at the bottom of the drop and making it over the hill and to the end with ease."
453,"First, we did some learning with initial drops as well as a simulation."
704,"Because total energy is just all the different types of energy added up, the total energy stayed the same this entire time."
668,E1: The drop height is going to be 5 because that will give it enough energy to make it over the hill.
162,Also you need to have enough energy to get to the end of the track so you want to have a high initial drop and a big car mass to give it the most TE possible.
836,"When i increased the height to 4, it was 1955 joules, the PE increase at 549 joules."
781,This was the only test where our cart failed to cross the hill.
715,"We decided on 3.5 for the hill because its a little more then half way, and the mass going down so much will make the energy go down."
106,Making 60 kg a better weight because it provides more TE.
324,"When I increased the drop height to 4 meters, the PE increased at 2166 Joules."
210,"For example in trial number 3 when the drop height and hill height are the same, the car doesn't have enough energy to make it over the hill."
44,A similar thing happens to the kinetic energy at the bottom of the initial drop.
225,We've just completed testing on the car mass.
717,it will slow down because we also have a straight line at the end eventually making it stop.
709,It will work because the penitential energy (PE) and kinetic energy (KE) would not be an issue.
791,"We decided to choose the in-between, 50 kilograms."
119,"For example, in the data we collected, when the initial drop height was 5 m and the hill height was 3.50 m, the cart was able to go over the hill with ease."
322,This is because the height was the largest it could be and the energy gave it enough momentum to go all the way down and over the hill.
607,This means that it must be transferred to another energy source just like kinetic energy to potential energy.
739,"For example, when I tested the drop height of 4 metres, the PE was 1955 Joules (J)."
277,"E1R: We started at a release height of 2 meters then we tested the height at 3,4 and then 5 meters."
516,Having a greater total energy will help the coaster car make it over the hill and loop.
522,But when i tested the mass of 60 the total energy was 2934.
710,Lets break it down.
294,These simulations were all tested with no friction.
5,then still had energy (momentum) to keep going to get to the end.
754,Remember that the hill height cannot be as high or higher than the initial drop or the cart will not make it over the hill.
124,"For example, the initial drop height is set at 5 m, and the cart mass is 52 kg."
532,total energy stays the same even when PE and KE are converting back and forth.
663,"for example, when I tested a 60kg car it had 2,933J of PE at the top of a 5m hill, but when I tested a 40kg car it only had 1,955J of PE at the top of the same hill."
61,"When the car mass is 40 kg, the potential energy at the top of the initial drop is 1955 J and the kinetic energy at the bottom is 1949 J."
41,This is the best height because it will create the most potential energy at the top of the drop and the most kinetic energy at the bottom.
265,"This proves that the greater height, the more total energy."
172,When the car goes up the loop it will need enough energy to make it over.
36,"When the car mass is 40 kg, the potential energy at the top of the initial drop is 1955 J and the kinetic energy at the bottom is 1949 J."
741,"To explain energy on a roller coaster, we have to look at the Law of Conservation of Energy (LCE)."
309,"When I increased the drop height to 4 meters, the PE"
643,"Once all passenger who don't want to continue are off the cart now full of potential energy, drops having its potential energy transform into kinetic."
493,if we have a greater PE then there will be more speed and more TE.
380,I made this hill this height so as you get up the hill you will not be losing a tone of KE.
547,"For example, when releasing the cart from 4 meters, at the top of the initial drop was 883 PE and 0 KE, but it changed."
515,So the total energy will stay the same but the energy with convert from PE to KE and the other way around.The energy will change when it is going down the drop the PE will be less but now it is going faster so KE will go up.
655,Then it will go through 2 loops each one higher than the one before so the cart can make it to the end.
178,"And because the PE is the greatest, the TE will also be the greatest."
78,"Overall, I think that the Gonzales family needs to make their initial drop higher than the hills and loops."
620,"It involves science, technology, and physics and it will be able to make it to the end with pure thrill in the costumer's eyes."
163,"Also if you want the ride to be fun, you will want a high drop height and a lot of energy."
826,And at the bottom of the drop and hill it will have more kinetic energy when compared to a roller coaster with only 40 kg.
691,"Because total energy is just all the different types of energy added up, in this case potential and kinetic, the total energy stayed the same this entire time."
80,"So then everybody who rides the ride will have a fun, enjoyable, exciting, and safe experience."
18,This is the best height because it will create the most potential energy at the top of the drop and the most kinetic energy at the bottom.
203,"For example, in trial number 2 the amount of KE is 0, the amount of PE is 1466 J and the TE is 1466 J."
50,"However, in the simulation, the kinetic energy is usually a few joules short of equaling the total energy because the car is still slightly above the ground, therefore giving it height and some potential energy."
646,"E1R: Dear, Gonzales family."
494,After the initial drop we should add a hill that is 3 ft high.
248,"As for the hill after the drop, we also plan on making the height as high as possible."
293,"For example, with a car mass of 60 kg the PE was 2444 J but with a 40 kg car the PE was 2446."
67,"But if there isn't enough total energy, the cart will not make it over the hills."
442,E1R: The Gonzales family should use my roller coaster design because it meets the criteria they are looking for.
390,I made the mass of my car in my model 50 kg to give it more PE to convert to KE to really make sure it will make it over.
334,if you do it too small it just won't have as much energy.
608,Drop height will always start with 0 kinetic energy and will have to be higher than the hill height to be able to make it over.
600,Potential energy is how much potential the car has/will have.
846,Mass affects the energy of a roller coaster.
357,If we look at my add a hill data we can see that all the rides made it all the way through except the one that had the same hill height has the initial drop.
266,This is true for every trial.
213,This happens in trial number 2 which states the PE at the top of the initial drop is 1958 J and the KE is 0 J.
736,E1: Our team's roller coaster will have a starting height of 4 metres.
526,So when we add friction there is other types of energy that will need to be included thermal and sound energy.
627,"It involves science, technology, and physics and it will be able to make it to the end with pure thrill in the customer's eyes."
133,This is the process.
750,"This, as a result, will build speed."
513,That is because the Law of conservation of energy.
2,From the initial drop our cart worked nicer when it had a higher car mass so a heavier cart will be beneficial.
787,Not because it's larger but because it's denser than the rock.
745,"When we had an initial drop height of 5 metres and a hill height of 5 metres, the cart failed to pass the hill, but every other trial succeeded."
101,Still having it be fun and safe.
272,Let us know if you have any changes or recommendations.
43,"However, when the initial drop height was 5 m, the potential energy was 2443 J at the top of the initial drop."
675,The larger the mass the slower the cart is so if you have to much mass it also won't make it over the hill.
558,E1R: The drop heigh of my roller coaster design is 4 meters.
599,If the drop of my coaster is higher it will have more potential energy at the top and more kinetic energy at the bottom.
479,"For example, I did a hill height of 5.00 meters with the initial drop height staying the same throughout the simulation being 5.00 meters."
112,All of these play a part in the cart making it to the end of the ride with out it needing to stop or fall back and try to restart.
445,"In Trial 4, when the drop was 2.00 m the total amount of energy was 976 J."
748,"Lowering the hill height, even by a fourth of a metre, would allow the cart to successfully pass the hill and move on."
451,"During the roller coaster and energy analysis, we have learned all about potential energy, kinetic energy, total energy, car energy/mass, initial drops, hills, etc."
323,Lower height didn't provide enough PE.
17,E1: I think that the height of the initial drop should be 5 meters.
414,I think these recommendations would make the best safe and fun roller coaster.
510,For example when i tested the height of 5 the total energy was 2443.
363,"You need to know the potential and kinetic energy , you need to know is how to make a ride that can finish all the way through."
220,"E1: Dear Gonzales family, your roller coaster is in great progress."
843,"The relationship between PE, KE, and mass was the higher the mass and the drop height made the PE or KE change in the amount of energy they had."
637,While the cart shouldn't be able to make it up the 600 ft hill since there isn't enough kinetic energy we will have magnets shoot and then pull you up.
829,Proving that the total energy stayed the same through out the runs.
665,"in a frictionless world, the PE will directly convert to KE."
326,The more mass something has the more energy it produces.
752,"At the very top, PE is TE, and KE is always 0."
746,"The initial PE was 2449 J, and the Kinetic Energy (KE) before the cart went backwards was 12 J."
251,We've just completed testing on the car mass.
626,"My team has been working on this idea for a while now and we think you'll like it, it is called the Top Thrill Dragster."
678,When the car mass was 50 the totel energy was 1958 at the top and bottom so it never changed.
74,"Also, when I set the hill height to 4.75 m. There was enough total energy to make it over the hill when the initial drop height was 5 meters."
625,E1R: My proposal is this: you allow my team to give you an idea that could save your business and open a new attraction to your park.
743,"If a hill is taller than your initial drop, your cart will not make it to the top and never will as it will not gain or lose any more energy."
335,for the weight of the cart.
28,The energies are transferring among themselves as the car moves through the ride.
412,"This means that the energy almost entirely switched, which will make it easier for the cart to go over the hill."
605,"For example if you start with 1,000 joules of potential energy and have 0 kinetic energy, you will have a total of 1,000 joules of energy."
211,This is because it doesn't have the extra energy from the initial drop because it already used it up trying to get over the hill that is the same height.
366,"I think the Gonzales family should choose my ride because I will make sure that my ride is safe , fun and includes all things that go into a ride."
254,"That's all for the updates, but we want to bring up a few key points."
506,but if we have a 3 ft hill then the PE would be 1466.
541,"For example, when I tested the drop height of 2 meters, the PE was 883 Joules."
645,This is why the roller coaster i have come up with will be a great addition to the park.
449,"The mass of the cart has to be higher, in order for the coaster car to make it over the hill."
407,"For example, when we tested a hill height of 5 meters, which is the same as the initial drop, the cart did not make it over the hill."
165,"Because I will have the initial drop height at 400m and the first loop at 300m, that car will be able to make it past that loop."
125,The total energy was 2524 J.
486,The more mass the coaster car has the less the speed will be.
108,This is so then there can be enough total energy to make it over the hills and around the loops.
603,One dropping down the hill the kinetic energy shifts perfectly in line with the potential energy.
431,"For example in Trial 1, the initial drop height of the roller coaster was 5.00 m. Which caused the Potential energy at the top of the drop to be 2443 J, and the Kinetic energy at the top of the drop to be 0 J."
291,"Lastly, the more mass you have the Less PE, KE and TE you will have."
613,"When I increased the drop height to 5 meters, the PE was much greater and had enough energy to make it over the hill."
155,"When I did the test I saw that when the initial drop height was 5m and the hill was 5m the car did not make it over, but when the hill height was 4m the car did make it over."
813,There will be more potential energy at the of the drop and more kinetic energy at the bottom of it.
25,This is because the car is not moving- kinetic energy comes from motion.
88,And the KE was at 2448J which still isn't enough to make it over.
135,"Now, when you want to add a hill, you need to be aware of how tall it will be, or the cart might not be able to get over."
358,If you look at the other hill heights they are all below 5.00 m and they made it all the way through to the end.
570,"For example in testing, when the hill height was 3 meters high and the initial drop was 5 meters, the car had 778 joules of KE at the top of the hill and made it over."
128,"E1R: When building this roller coaster, you will need to consider the initial drop height, the hills height, the mass of the cart and the total energy."
