132,When we dropped the roller costar cart from 2 meters it didn't go as fast or as far and make it to the end of the track because the PE at the top was 977.
336,The car should be 60 kg.
238,This would mean that the PE would also be 2443 at the top of the initial drop and the KE would be 2443 at the bottom of the initial drop.
541,Any hills that are added to the ride must be lower as compared to the initial drop height.
562,I found the height of the hill has to have less PE at the top of the hill than the PE at the initial drop.
572,This shows that the greater the mass the more energy will be transferred over time.
355,One last detail on the coaster are the hills.
187,I also believe this because of how fast my teams roller coaster will go.
124,proving that you should use our design because out coaster will go farther then others.
328,Then at the top of the hill the PE was 1959 J and the KE was 489 J and had enough energy to go up the hill.
86,"The hill should be 3m tall, with the 5m drop the 3m hill the car will make it over the hill."
95,"the pe, and ke will always be the same as long as the ride ends on the ground."
537,It had
64,The drop height relates to the kinetic energy at the bottom.
563,My data shows that all of the hill heights that were less than 4.5 meters worked.
256,When the cart is at the end it was 0 PE and whatever the PE was at the initial drop.
161,"Knowing that most people who go on roller coasters love the fast ones, we made ours fast."
548,"When I used a car that had a mass of 60 kg, the roller coaster car had a total energy 2934j."
89,The pe for a 60kg car will be 2933J but when I decreased the mass to 50kg the pe was only 2444.
519,The car mass for my roller coaster design is 60kg.
674,"Also when the height is greater so is the connected energy at the bottom, at 5 meters the KE at the bottom was 2442 but when at 4 meters the KE at the bottom was 1954."
599,"For example, when I tested the drop height of 2 meters, the PE was 1173 at the top of the drop."
408,"In one of my trials, the initial drop height was 4.00 the TE was 1955, the TE of the hill height was 1959 and my car made it."
375,At the end of the ride all the PE is converted to KE.
159,It will also make it exciting because in the ride It'll go around loops and up hills faster giving it more of a thrill.
78,It would also be less likely for the cart to make it over the hill because it doesn't have enough energy/kinetic energy to get all the way up and down the hill.
839,"This is shown in my data because when I had a hill height of 4 m, the car had 529 J of KE, but when I decreased the hill height to 3 m, the car had 1068 J of KE."
333,Then there will be a loop and the reason it is 4 m is the same reason as the hill.
10,Also then we can make the roller coaster fun reliable and extremely safe.
347,The first trial had a release height of 2.4 m. This height produced a total energy of 1220 J.
276,"For example, if the initial drop height is 4 meters, i will have 1955 J of energy, while if it has an initial drop height of 5 meters, it will have 2443 J of energy, which is more than 4 meters."
840,"This shows that the greater the hill height, the less energy the car will have, meaning we want a low enough hill height for the energy to make it all the way up the hill safely."
255,If there is no KE then there is no velocity.
31,We are constantly adding to ideas and things we can changes to make this ride enjoyable.
497,Then at the bottom the PE was 1J and the KE was 1954J.
267,"E1R: I would recommend to make the initial drop 5 m because then the PE will be higher, meaning more PE at the beginning the same KE at the end."
142,When dealing with energy you need to keep the Law conservation of energy in mind.
764,Then how does potential turn into kinetic its because it transforms into the other.
792,"But when the car's mass was less, the car had less PE, KE, and TE."
826,Most often being transferred into KE this is why the total energy will stay the becasue the energy does go away and KE doesnt just appear.
473,When thinking to both drops the potential energy starts with all the energy the roller coaster has.
352,"A cart's mass may seem to not be important, but it actually can have a great affect on the energy of the ride."
698,E1: We should start the roller coaster at 5 meters for the initial drop.
467,If the hill were higher or the same height the cart would not be able to get over it.
259,When all the energy is TE then the cart is at a stop.
606,"For example, when the drop was 3 meters, the PE at the top of the drop was 1762, and the KE was 0."
344,My proposal is to make a roller coaster with the highest initial drop height possible.
98,"With a drop height of 5 meters, the pe at the top was 2443J and the ke at the bottom was 2442J the total energy for that drop was 2443."
807,"Another example is when I had a 5 meter drop the PE at the top was 2199 but at the bottom is was zero, and at the top the KE was zero but at the bottom the PE was zero."
2,We also got the perfect amount of energy at the bottom of the coaster.
65,After the cart went through the roller coaster at the bottom there would be a lot less potential energy and a lot of kinetic energy.
448,"In ""Mass and Energy Data"" it shows that when my car's mass was at the highest (60kg) it had 2937J of energy causing it to not stop until the end."
371,I know having as much total energy as possible is best because of energy conversion.
571,"But, in my trials where the car was 60 kg the total energy was 2644 J."
744,"So for that reason, the hill height must be smaller than the initial drop height."
719,and the relationship between KE and PE and total energy.
443,"In ""Initial Drop Data"" it showed that the tallest drop which was 5m had the greatest amount of energy 2443J."
213,If the cart weighs 40 kg it has 1959 PE at the top and 1955 KE at the bottom of the drop.
559,"But, at the drop height of 3 meters, the car had 1465 Joules of KE at the bottom of the initial drop."
30,we also made this roller coaster having many twist and turns to make it fun and safe.
628,"Both inversions would come after the two of the hills, the hills would be all in different parts of the ride."
410,So you should make your initial drop at 4.00 m. Your hill height should be at 3.69.
354,"The cart with the least mass of 46 kg had 1570 J of total energy, while the cart with the most mass of 60 kg had 2054 J of total energy."
290,For example when I did an Initial Drop height of 5 m and had a hill height of 5 m it didn't go over the hill because it did not have enough energy.
47,So like for our roller coaster since it drops from a high height it has lots of potential energy at the start and then has a bunch of kinetic energy at the bottom.
101,The mass of the car should be 60kg.
732,and most of an even split between PE and KE is when the cart is going down the hill.
816,When I had a car mass of 40kg the PE at the top of the drop was only 1958 but when we bumped up the mass to 60kgs the PE went up to 2936.
452,However with my shortest drop of 2m it only had 977J of total energy.
198,My 3.15m hill made it all the way meanwhile my 5.00m hill did not.
784,"At the bottom, however, the energy changed to KE because the car was in motion and the PE has fewer joules because there was no more stored energy."
111,When we dropped the roller costar cart from 2 meters it didn't go as fast or as far and make it to the end of the track because the PE at the top was 977.
81,The quicker the cart went through the rollercoaster.
446,My reason for a heavy car is that it increases potential energy.
58,Yesterday when we were doing trials with different car masses my group noticed that the higher the mass was the more energy.
739,"In a frictionless world, our models have shown the total energy is the same as the potential energy in the beginning and the kinetic energy at the end."
287,I think the initial drop height should be 60 m and then have a hill that is 50 m tall and I will explain to you why I think this.
41,E1: We are starting our rollercoaster drop height at 5m.
671,I want to have the drop height at 5 meters because height and Energy are directly related.
402,So that is my ideas to the Gonzales family to make their roller coasters better.
6,Are roller coaster is going to have a mass of 45kg to make the coaster perfectly safe and fun.
160,I also believe this because of how fast my teams roller coaster will go.
513,"For example, when i tested the drop height of 2 meters, the PE was 0 joules."
341,"E1: Dear Gonzalez family,"
564,But the 5 meter hill height did not work because PE at the top of the hill was 2202 J.
288,You said you wanted an exciting roller coaster so I made the drop height 60 m. I didn't want to make it too tall and have it take up too much space but I also didn't want it to be boring.
392,This is our idea Gonzales family.
179,"For example, one of my carts had the mass of 60 and had the PE of 2790 and the KE of 2772."
107,"First our design works well, our design was built with speed and success in mind."
419,One example is with a drop height of 2.50 meters the PE at the top was 1334 joules and at the bottom of the drop the KE was at 1333 joules.
340,All of this is why you should choose my design for an initial drop height of 5 m and a hill height of 4 m. Thank you for your time.
776,The PE and KE were the same at the bottom because the car didn't make it over the hill.
704,The best decision for the height of the hill would be 4 meters and here's why.
472,In my simulator I put the hill at 4.25 because it was shorter than the 5.00 initial drop but high enough to still be thrilling.
44,The drop height relates to the kinetic energy at the bottom.
319,At the bottom the KE was 2442 J and the PE was 1 J.
823,PE is the kind of energy it will have at the top of any part of the ride when the car is completely still but still has more movement still left to come.
66,This is because the object went through a ton of speed to get to the bottom.
131,So when that cart fell from 5 meters the PE at the top was 2443.
309,All of this is why you should choose my design for an initial drop height of 60 m and a hill height of 50 m. Thank you for your time.
781,"Well, it was transferred between KE and PE."
761,2m had a potential energy of 1173 joules and 3m had a drop of 1759 joules.
249,"We tested 4 heights 5, 4, 3, and 2 meters."
133,So you should use our design because we have a higher drop and the roller coaster cart makes it to the end of the track successfully.
24,Are roller coaster is going to have a mass of 45 kg to make the coaster perfectly safe and fun.
146,Potential energy is at the top because it's saying how much energy it could have bu the Kinetic energy is what it really has so that's why it's at the bottom.
163,This drop will give you lots of power to go up the hills and loops after that.
231,"Such as a cart with a mass of 60 kg, this cart has 2938 PE at the top of the drop and 2932 KE at the bottom."
451,"When you have a greater amount of potential energy, you will in turn have a greater amount of kinetic energy.The total energy is the overall amount of energy in the coaster, meaning that your kinetic and potential energy are a part of the total energy of your coaster."
102,The pe for a 60kg car will be 2933J but when I decreased the mass to 50kg the pe was only 2444.
608,The PE and KE always balance each other out.
196,There is less PE and KE when the hill is smaller.
96,"When the drop height was 5m the 2443 and a ke of 2442 at the bottom of the hill, when the drop height was 3 m the pe was 1466 and the ke was 1465."
657,And potential energy means how much energy can be in an object another thing to keep in mind is that the law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed.
87,When the hill height was 3m the car made it over the hill but when the height was increased to 5m the car could not make it over the hill.
504,When the car mass was 40kg then the PE at the top was 1956J and then the KE was 1954J at the bottom.
586,"In order to fully make it through the ride we need alot ofkinetic energy, and in order to get this needed energy we need potential energy."
762,Potential energy is the foundation of the fun and speed of a coaster and that's why the higher the better and why my team is having a 5m drop.
634,More people will be attracted to your park because of this coaster.
72,Kinetic energy is the energy of a moving object so all rollercoasters at the start have 0 kinetic energy because the cart is not moving but has a lot of potential energy.
219,This also goes for any height that you have.
745,Our group's hill height is 3 because our initial drop height is 5.
423,At the initial drop of 5 meters the PE is at 2668 joules but at the bottom of the drop the PE is at 0.
18,E1R: We are going to gave are roller coaster drop height of 5 meters doing so has the perfect amount of potential energy and just enough potential energy at the bottom.
799,"The more energy, the faster and more exciting the roller coaster will be."
175,These energies effect each other because the energies can NOT be created or destroyed.
266,As you can see the lower the mass the lower the PE and KE.
528,How PE KE and Total Energy works.
481,In my simulation the 60 kg cart had the greatest amount of energy over the 40 kg cart.
640,The best way to make a roller coaster is to have people have fun and be feared by the coaster.
483,E1R: My claim is that I can help the Gonzalez family make a safe and thrilling roller coaster.
756,Total energy is the amount of energy stored or expelled in the object.
510,"Also, it shows that the TE stays the same throughout the whole ride because when the initial drop was 3m, then the TE at the start was 1466J and at the bottom was also 1466J."
29,We have done many test and problem solving to make this coaster the most fun and safe reliable roller coaster you can ride.
349,With a difference of almost 600 joules it is easy to see that higher is better for maximum energy and fun.
251,The height of 2 m had a PE of 997 J.
253,Since there is no friction the KE will be what the PE is at the beginning because there is no thermal energy changing the energy into energy we can't use.
673,in our initial drop data when the drop was 5 meters the PE at the top was 2443 J compared to when the drop was at 2 meters the PE was 977 J.
666,This is why I believe the Gonzalez family should choose my roller coaster.
647,"I learned from my data that the more height causes more speed, the fastest initial height I found while still being safe was 3.60m tall."
406,Once you go the KE at the bottom of the drop is the same number as the PE at the top of the drop.
540,This means that energy will transfer from potential energy to kinetic energy and back again throughout the ride.
361,This law tells us that energy cannot be created or destroyed.
400,And then after the car makes it over the 4 meter hill the drop will be giving them enough energy to make it over the 3.5 meter hill.
250,The drop height of 5 m had a PE of 2492 J at the initial drop.
561,I found the initial drop height should be higher than the hills because the car has to have energy to make it to the end.
785,"To confirm that PE and KE transfer the energy between each other in another one of my trials the PE at the top of the initial drop was 1,955 J and KE 0 J."
318,But when I had a drop height of 5 m the PE at the top was 2443 J and the KE was 0 J.
755,Potential energy can be defined as the energy stored in an object which transforms into kinetic energy when in motion.
381,When the car mass is 50 the PE top of the initial drop (5m) would be 1958 J and KE bottom of Drop would be 1955 J.
366,"I know this because of my second experiment, where the first 3 trials of 2, 2,5, and 3 m hills all allowed the cart to go over as soon as the release height equaled the hill, the cart did not pass over."
475,But when the energy converts it is never adding more energy.
127,"Here I will prove to you all of the things I just said with data from test runs, logic, and the relation ships between energy and the track."
137,In our test drops when we had our hill at 2 meters the cart went over it without a problem because it had enough energy form our 5 meter drop to go over the 2 meter hill.
190,This drop will give you lots of power to go up the hills and loops after that.
618,"When the mass goes down, the KE goes down."
482,In conclusion you now know how roller coasters energy works and you now see that I can make a very fun and safe roller coaster.
7,"We have made this coaster to be the most fun and safe roller coaster but also make it to the perfect amount between friction, potential energy and kinetic energy."
110,So when that cart fell from 5 meters the PE at the top was 2443.
597,E1: The drop height of my roller coaster is 5 meters.
645,"The second coaster would start when the first coaster gets to the third hill, this adds safety and shorter lines."
833,"This is seen in my data because when my car mass was 60 kg, the TE was 2,934 J, but when I decreased the mass of the car to 50 kg, the TE was 2,445 J."
411,And the mass of your cart should be about 40 kg.
401,And then after the car makes it over the 3.5 meter hill it will have enough energy to make it over the 3 meter hill and then it goes on and on.
209,"E1: Dear Gonzales Family, 
If you want to have the best roller coaster possible you should have a pretty high initial drop height and also you can add some hills into it."
169,There is less PE and KE when the hill is smaller.
264,"We tested 3 masses 51 kg, 45 kg, and 40 kg."
46,This is because the object went through a ton of speed to get to the bottom.
45,After the cart went through the roller coaster at the bottom there would be a lot less potential energy and a lot of kinetic energy.
91,"When the mass is 60kg the pe was 2933J and had a ke of 2932J of ke, but when the mass was 40kg the pe was 1955 and had a ke of 1955."
200,"These different initial drops effect the PE, KE, and TE because the higher the drop the more PE and the lower the drop the less."
218,But once you get to the bottom of it there is more KE and no PE.
717,and for us the designers to make it and the higher the drop the more total energy there will be.
82,We also noticed that when the mass was lower it sometimes wouldn't make it up hills or get all the way through.
11,We have done many test and problem solving to make this coaster the most fun and safe reliable roller coaster you can ride.
245,"So when you take cart mass, initial drop height, and hill height into consideration, these things can determine whether the coaster will work or not work."
659,Another thing is that the more mass the coaster has will also affect the PE and KE of the coaster.
395,"First what they could do to make it last longer is have it go in loops so that the Gonzales family don't have to make the roller coaster long itself, just the time."
394,I also recommend that they make it more fun as well and hear how i think they can do that.
324,But then at the top of the hill or close to the top of the hill the PE was 2449 J and the KE was 1 J.
621,"This is because the greater the height, the greater the energy."
214,Compared to a cart that has a heavier mass.
308,"This is why I have the hill height at 50 m, to make sure that the car will have enough energy to go over the hill and make it safely to the end."
676,The TE is always the amount of KE and PE when there's no friction.
104,"When the mass was 60kg the pe was 2933J and had a ke of 2932J of ke, but when the mass was 40kg the pe was 1955 and had a ke of 1955."
568,I found that the mass of the car has to be heavier in order for the car to gain energy as it rides.
393,E1: I recommend that the Gonzales family could make the roller coaster last longer to make people think that they are getting their money's worth.
662,E1R: I believe that my design or the Gonzales roller coaster would be the best.
99,"When the drop was decreased to 4m The hill should be 3m tall, with the 5m drop the 3m hill the car will make it over the hill."
23,The relationship between the drop and the initial drop is 1 meter.
679,"When the height was 2 meters the PE was 977 and KE was 0 but at the Bottom, the KE was 977 and the PE was zero."
751,This means that the total energy is the same as the PE in the beginning and the KE in the end.
743,If it isn't the roller coaster car won't go over the hill.
307,Then at the top of the hill the PE was 2450 J and the KE was 489 J and had enough energy to go over the hill.
775,"In a trial, when the height of the initial drop was 5m and the hill height was 5m the car's PE at the top of the initial drop was 2,446 J and the KE was 0 J."
442,This means that increasing the potential energy will make the roller coaster have more kinetic energy as it moves.
607,"When added, they equal 1762, which is the total energy."
166,The PE and KE also is affected when the cart goes up and down our hills.
382,The total energy would be 1958 which would be good because the car would not need friction to get over the kill which would make it very fun for customers.
654,So the hill will be small enough for the coaster to cross over it will have less kinetic energy when it reaches the top of the hill KE.
675,"The relationship between PE, KE, and TE is pretty clear, with no friction the TE is always the same as the starting PE, and it doesn't change either at the end of the ride ."
728,1955 J.
9,We have made this roller coaster to be the safest and the most fun roller coaster so then it is fun and reliable and safe so then we can prevent the bad things that may happen during the roller coaster.
396,"What i mean by that is instead of them going around the track only one time, the Gonzales family could make it go around two time instead."
338,For example when the car mass was 40 kg the total energy was 1985 J.
457,You also need to have enough energy from the initial drop to make it all the way to the end of the roller coaster.
822,In other words PE and height have a direct relationship.
403,E1R: I recommend that the Gonzales family could make the roller coaster last longer to make people think that they are getting their money's worth.
105,"E1: Dear Gonzales family, 
You should build our design because it works well, and people will like it."
369,"E1R: Dear Gonzalez family,"
437,THIS WAS DONE IN A FRICTIONLESS SIMULATION.
243,For example when you are at the top of an initial drop you have a certain amount of PE.
235,This also goes for any height that you have.
793,"For example in my trials when the car's mass was 60 the PE was 2,932 J at the top of the initial drop and 2,932 J of KE and at the bottom of the drop, the TE was also 2,932."
114,In a roller coaster we all know there are many ups and downs to make it more fun for the rider in our roller coaster we added a hill after the drop out hill is 2 meters tall.
706,Since the hill has to be shorter than the drop it should be 1 meter below 5 meters which is 4 meters so it has the most momentum.
315,For example when I had a drop height of 2.5 the PE at the top was 1222 J and the KE was 0 J.
759,Getting into why this is important in a roller coaster is because fun is speed that is important.
28,Also then we can make the roller coaster fun reliable and extremely safe.
221,Once you get closer towards the bottom the energy starts to transfer from one to another.
652,A hill will be added to slow down the coaster so it has a smoother ride to the end.
215,"Such as a cart with a mass of 60 kg, this cart has 2938 PE at the top of the drop and 2932 KE at the bottom."
325,And because of this it wasn't able to go over the hill because it didn't have enough energy.
185,"This is because the cart doesn't need as much energy to go around these loops or hills when they're smaller vs when they're bigger, also giving it more total energy."
94,The pe of the 5 m drop was 2443J but when I decreased the height to 4 m the pe was 1955J.
461,In the roller coaster simulation the highest drop (5.00) had the most stored energy (PE) so it could go the farthest.
113,Seconded I want to talk about how our roller coaster works well because of the hill.
455,E1: My claim is that I can help the Gonzalez family make a safe and thrilling roller coaster.
85,"When the drop height was 5m the 2443 and a ke of 2442 at the bottom of the hill, when the drop height was 3 m the pe was 1466 and the ke was 1465."
827,"E1: One recommendation I want to make to the Gonzales family is to have the initial drop height be 5 meters, so that the coaster car will have enough energy to safely make it through the entire ride."
426,E1R: The drop height for my coaster design is 5 meters.
644,"These lines would be very long since it’s a long coaster, so I think the best way to counter the long lines would be to have two coasters going at the same time."
225,"E1R: Dear Gonzales Family, 
If you want to have the best roller coaster possible you should have a pretty high initial drop height and also you can add some hills into it."
15,We have calculated the perfect amount of potential energy and kinetic energy but with a little bit of friction.
306,At the initial drop the PE was 2448 J and the KE was 0 J.
567,"This shows that if the hill height is taller than the initial drop height then, the coaster won't make it to the end."
282,"E1R: I suggest having a really high drop, a hill that is about 4/5 the size of the initial drop, and the coaster cars should be heavy."
109,"In one of our test drops when the cart fell from 5 meters it went through the entire coaster because when the PE at the top of the coaster is higher, the faster the roller coaster cart will go."
689,"Also when the height is greater so is the kinetic energy at the bottom, at 5 meters the Kinetic Energy at the bottom was 2442 but when at 4 meters the KE at the bottom was 1954."
141,"Third I wanted to talk about the relationship between PE, KE and total energy."
582,"E1: For what your requesting, I recommend we have a drop height of 5 meters."
619,"This means that when there is a greater mass, there is a greater energy."
33,We have calculated the perfect amount of potential energy and kinetic energy but with a little bit of friction.
292,The amount of energy there is depends on how much PE and KE there is.
0,E1: We are going to gave are roller coaster drop height of 5 meters doing so has the perfect amount of potential energy and just enough potential energy at the bottom.
834,One thing to be aware of is how PE and KE can convert from one to the other as the car is moving.
316,At the bottom the KE was 1221 J and the PE was 1 J.
545,Our last experiment was comparing mass and energy.
303,When I had an initial drop height of 5 m and a hill 5 m the PE at the top of the initial drop was 2450 J and 0 J for KE.
544,"However, when I tested a drop height of 5.00m and a hill height of 2.50 m, the roller coaster car went over the hill."
632,"E1R: Dear, The Gonzalez Family."
819,E1R: The drop height for my roller coaster is going to be 5 meters.
22,We got rid of friction.
74,"Total energy
While the cart goes down the drop the potential starts to decrease very quickly and the kinetic energy number increases really quickly because the cart is moving and not just sitting still."
140,You should use our design because we added fun and successful hills into our coaster.
578,When the car is released from the initial drop height there is more KE being produced over the ride.
277,"The reason for the hill being about 4/5 the size of the initial drop is that if the hill is the same height as the initial drop, the coaster car will not have enough energy to get to the other side."
611,"When the PE goes down, the KE goes up."
353,My third experiment gave me trials to prove that a bigger cart is better.
493,Then at the bottom of the drop the PE was 1J and the KE was 1465J which has a TE of 1466J.
173,"These different initial drops effect the PE, KE, and TE because the higher the drop the more PE and the lower the drop the less."
433,"potential energy transforms into kinetic energy, and kinetic energy converts into potential energy, and then back again."
416,The higher your initial drop height is the more PE you will have at the top of the drop.
750,"In a frictionless world, our models have shown that the total energy is the same as the potential energy in the beginning and the kinetic energy at the end."
552,"The ride will be fun and exiting but, also safe for everyone."
518,When i increased the hill height to 4 the PE at the top of the hill increased at 1734 joules.
49,Kinetic energy is the energy of a moving object so all rollercoasters at the start have 0 kinetic energy because the cart is not moving but has a lot of potential energy.
320,And it had a total energy of 2443.
234,But once you get to the bottom of it there is more KE and no PE.
843,You want to make sure you have enough energy for the whole ride.
682,"Even when a car has friction, the friction creates non-useful energy no energy was destroyed it just kind of went away into the surroundings."
130,"In one of our test drops when the cart fell from 5 meters it went through the entire coaster because when the PE at the top of the coaster is higher, the faster the roller coaster cart will go."
514,"when i increased the drop height to 5 meters, the PE increased at 1 joule."
580,I found that the more weight there is the more TE there will be.
566,"Also, in my trials where the hill height 5 meters did not make it, but the lower hills made it to the end."
601,That means that the PE was increased when the height increased.
778,"In one of my trials for the initial drop, the coaster car started with 2,443 Joules of PE and 0 Joules of KE at the top of the initial drop."
738,When the KE is higher the PE is lower.
367,"In conclusion, the secret to the best roller coaster is simple."
723,So we know that the energy will have to change from one source to another when the coaster is going down the drop the PE will change into KE because the cart is moving.
802,PE is the kind of energy it will have at the top of any part of the ride when the car is completely still but still has more movement left to come.
180,This cart had more mass than my other cart which had the mass of 43 and had the PE of 1981 and KE of 1978.
150,The mass of the cart effects the energy that the cart has for the ride.
643,The roller coaster would be the most fun and scariest in your park.
795,"For example, when the car's mass was 50 kg the TE was 2,444 J at the start and 2,444 J at the end."
222,"So when you take cart mass, initial drop height, and hill height into consideration, these things can determine whether the coaster will work or not work."
725,because you need to have enough energy to make it.
450,"E1R: The Gonzales family should have a high initial drop, a hill shorter than the initial drop and a heavy car."
830,"You want to make sure you have enough energy for the whole ride, so you want to have a big TE."
380,"Gonzales Family, the drop is going to be 5m because the total energy is substantial to the height of the hill."
767,That's why i'm choosing a 3.5m hill to have a balance of speed and fun to mix the the actual ability of the coaster.
171,My 3.15m hill made it all the way meanwhile my 5.00m hill did not.
170,"I know this because in my data I collected, My 5.00m hill had 2327 PE and 2 KE, meanwhile my 3.15m hill had 2324 PE and 777 KE."
449,All in all my reasoning and evidence show that the initial height should be taller than the hill height as well as the car should be heavy.
19,We calculated the perfect amount of potential energy and kinetic energy to make the ride safe and fun at the same time.
207,This cart had more mass than my other cart which had the mass of 43 and had the PE of 1981 and KE of 1978.
658,It only transfers from the two different types.
12,we also made this roller coaster having many twist and turns to make it fun and safe.
25,"We have made this coaster to be the most fun and safe roller coaster but also make it to the perfect amount between friction, potential energy and kinetic energy."
809,So when the PE goes from a high number to zero the energy doesnt go away instead it is just transferred into a new type of energy.
203,It transforms itself from one to the another and that is why the PE and KE effect the TE.
532,This is important because.a 5 meters drop gives us the highest PE .
456,To have a safe roller coaster you have to make sure that the cart is safe and that the drops and twists are safe as well.
304,But then at close to the top of the hill the PE was 2449 J and 1 J for KE and it didn't have enough energy to get back up the hill and over.
365,"If the hill requires more KE than the cart has to spend, it will not make it over the hill."
604,"This also shows the relationship between PE, KE, and total energy."
334,"The same rules apply, it has to be shorter than the initial drop so it can make it over and to the end."
186,It will also make it exciting because in the ride It'll go around loops and up hills faster giving it more of a thrill.
153,proving that you should use our design because out coaster will go farther then others.
525,The PE should be higher than the KE so the car makes it to the end of the ride.
350,Another important factor is the mass of the cart.
136,Our hill is 2 meters tall so that the roller coaster cart can get over it and it wont stop mid way.
648,This height would give the fastest speeds possible while being safe.
208,"This shows that the more mass of the cart, the more energy which means the cart is faster and better and why you should choose my teams roller coaster."
69,"For example, my initial drop height data had 977J of pe and 0J of ke."
707,This means that it will go for the longest and the fastest because it has the most total energy.
268,The total energy depends on the PE at the begging because there is no friction.
343,"Using what I have learned about mass, height, and the laws of physics I know how to make the fastest, safest, and most fun roller coaster possible."
17,We are constantly changing and modifying are roller coaster to be the safest it could possibly be so then we do not have problems and the people can enjoy the coaster
458,When thinking of energy the only way for the cart to make it to the end is to have a high and fast initial drop.
314,You said you wanted an exciting roller coaster so I made the drop height 5 m. You said you wanted an exciting ride so I put the drop height as 5 m. Because it was the highest it could be and it had the most energy.
468,This is because there is not enough stored energy from the drop to make it to the top of the hill that is the same or higher.
803,KE is movement energy so we will have KE in our model once the car has started to go down the hill and it will keep increasing until it stops moving at the bottom of the hill.
229,If the cart weighs 40 kg it has 1959 PE at the top and 1955 KE at the bottom of the drop.
489,E1: Some recommendations I would make to the Gonzales family is that I would make the drop height 5m.
727,"and the cart mass is 60 Kg the PE will be, 2931 J of PE at the top but if you have a cart that is 40 Kg, then the PE will be."
409,The mass of my cart was 40 kg.
115,Our hill is 2 meters tall so that the roller coaster cart can get over it and it wont stop mid way.
217,An example of this is when we have a initial drop height of 2 m there is going to be more PE at the top and less KE.
368,"Use a high release point for maximum energy, use a large mass cart to add more energy, and keep the hills low enough so the cart can pass through."
565,And the initial drop height's PE at the top was 2199 J from my initial drop data.
747,E1R: I want the height of the initial drop to be 5.
502,"Then when I did an initial drop height of 4m and the hill also 4m, then the roller coaster wouldn't make it over."
480,The cart with the greatest mass also had the greatest kinetic energy at the bottom of the drop.
5,The relationship between the drop and the initial drop is 1 meter.
48,Potential energy is the energy inside the object.
636,The hills would be all in different parts of the ride.
800,"For example height and PE have a direct relationship I know this becasue when I did my test and tested 2 meters the PE was 880 joules but when I tested 5 meters, the car had 2199 joules of PE."
579,I found the initial drop height should be higher than the hills because the car has to have enough energy to make it to the end.
16,We have added many different twist and turns but are concerned that we may not have enough speed to get through the entire roller coaster.
54,"So, for example, energy throughout a roller coaster is not getting destroyed it's either switching or the friction is turning into mechanical energy which turns into other forms of energy like heat+ thermal energy, and sound energy."
813,You keep the same amount of energy the whole time so as long as you make the hill smaller the car will have enough energy to get up that hill.
760,In my data that i collected comparing a 2m drop to a 3m drop shows higher potential energy at the top of the coaster.
3,So then it can make it up the 4 meter tall hill.
500,I would do this because you can't have a hill height that is taller than the initial drop height because of the conservation law of energy.
779,"At the bottom of the initial drop the PE was 1 Joule and the KE was 2,442 Joules."
388,E1R: Dear.
346,I know this because of the first experiment I conducted on the relationship of energy and height.
557,When the car is moving down the initial drop height there is more KE being produced over the ride.
348,The last and highest trial had a release height of 3.5 m. This height produced a total energy of 1708 J.
464,When creating my design I wanted the hill to be as high as it could.
271,KE is at the end or bottom.
26,so then it is perfectly safe and fun.
639,The more weight gives the ride more speed as I learned from my data.
323,Because at the initial drop the PE was 2450 J and the KE was 0 J.
59,The quicker the cart went through the rollercoaster.
280,"And if the coaster car is light, it will have less potential energy to be converted."
38,the energy transformation does not change between the potential energy and kinetic energy.
189,"In the beginning, you go through a dark tunnel then unexpectedly have a huge drop giving you that adrenaline rush."
291,For example when I had a drop height.
805,For example in my data at the 2 meter drop the PE at the beginning was 880 and it stayed that way all the way through the ride.
211,For example when the initial drop height is 5 m and the hill height is 5 m the cart can not make it over.
692,PE and KE are directly related.
534,"When I increased the drop height to 5 meters, the PE increased at 2443 Joules."
233,An example of this is when we have a initial drop height of 2 m there is going to be more PE at the top and less KE.
696,The total energy is the amount of PE plus KE.
499,"After the initial drop of 5m, I would make the hill height 4m and then the second hill height 3m."
811,They just transfer back and forth until they go to something else like thermal energy.
705,If we made the hill 4 meters people would have the most fun and still a very safe ride.
83,E1: The height of the drop should be 5 m. this will give the most pe to make it to the end of the ride.
752,"So for that reason, the hill height must be smaller than the initial drop height for the roller coaster car to be able to make it to the end."
202,These energies effect each other because the energies can NOT be created or destroyed.
560,This data shows that there was more KE at the end of the ride for the higher drop height of 5 meters.
195,"But the higher the hill, the more PE and KE it has."
379,E1: Dear.
232,"Initial drop height can effect what happens to the KE, PE, and total energy."
531,The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
462,The next thing you need is a hill.
549,"E1R: During my proposal to the Gonzales family, I will be sharing my findings about:"
184,"I know this because in my testing data, the lower the hill compared to the initial drop, the more total energy there is."
678,"It always starts with all PE but at the bottom, the PE transforms all its energy into KE."
515,The hill height of my roller coaster is 2 meters.
274,"E1: I suggest having a really high drop, a hill that is about 4/5 the size of the initial drop, and the coaster cars should be heavy."
508,Some of the energy because of friction would be turned into thermal and sound energy.
649,E1: I believe that my design or the Gonzales roller coaster would be the best.
126,"E1R: Dear Gonzales family, 
You should build our design because it works well, and people will like it."
593,kinetic energy and potential enegy have a direct relationship because when you have more potential energy the kinetic energy also go up.
92,E1R: The height of the drop should be 5 m. this will give the most pe to make it to the end of the ride.
138,But when we had out hill also at 5 meters the cart failed to go over because it didn't have enough energy form the 5 meter drop to go over it.
810,Most often being transferred into KE this is why the TE will stay the becasue the energy does go away and KE doesnt just appear.
145,The total energy takes the highest energy and becomes it.
589,"This relationship is shown in each one of my trials, for example, when the mass was 51kg it had the most amount of potential energy."
624,"When I added a hill, it always had to be lower than the drop height or else the car couldn't make it to the end."
835,PE will be greater when there is more height and KE will be greater when there is more motion.
248,"E1: I would recommend to make the initial drop 5 m because then the PE will be higher, meaning more PE at the beginning the same KE at the end."
509,E1R: Some recommendations I would make to the Gonzales family is that I would make the drop height 5m.
542,You can see this in my data.
536,It had 2444 J of KE at the bottom of the initial drop.
616,The mass and the energy has a direct relationship.
8,so then it is perfectly safe and fun.
623,"At the bottom of the drop, the total energy will equal the KE."
36,the total amount of energy is 1956 of the coaster the kinetic energy and potential energy will always be the same but just little changes.
168,"But the higher the hill, the more PE and KE it has."
312,And the car mass should be 60 kg.
370,Doing this will give the cart more total energy.
585,potential energy shows how many jules of energy the kart and the people in it will have.
749,Unlike when the initial drop is at a smaller height.
466,The hill also cannot be the same height.
71,Potential energy is the energy inside the object.
134,Seconded I want to talk about how our roller coaster works well because of the hill.
543,"When I tested a drop height of 5 m and a hill height of 5 m, the roller coaster car did not make it over the hill."
558,"Data I found when I was experimenting was when the car was released at the height 5 meters, the car had 2442 Joules of KE."
546,"The higher the mass of the car, the higher the total energy."
321,So the 5 m tall drop had 1221 J of energy more than the 2.5 m tall drop.
685,"When the hill and drop height were both at 5 meters the car didn't make it over the hill, yet when the hill height was 4 and the drop height was at 5 meters the car made it over the hill."
364,Once all the KE is converted to PE the only way it can move is back down.
522,When i increased the mass to 60kg the PE increased at 2368 joules.
181,"This shows that the more mass of the cart, the more energy which means the cart is faster and better and why you should choose my teams roller coaster."
326,But when the hill height was 4 it was able to go over.
772,E1: The height of the roller coaster's initial drop should be 5 meters.
454,But when my car was at it's lowest mass (40kg) it had only 1958J of total energy.
731,Is that when the cart is at the top of the drop there will be only PE because the cart is not moving.
39,at the start of the roller coaster the potential energy is the same as the kinetic energy at the end or very not very different at the end.
154,That is the end of my letter to you I hope this helps you decide that our design is the best and it will work very well.
533,"For example, when I tested the drop height of 2.5 meters, the PE was 1222 Joules."
524,E1R: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
377,(AKA maximum fun) I know this because of the first experiment I conducted on the relationship of energy and height.
237,So when the total energy is 2443.
445,"In ""Adding Hills Data"" my data showed, when my hill was the same height as my initial drop (5m) it did not make it to the end."
842,"E1R: One recommendation I want to make to the Gonzales family is to have the initial drop height be 5 meters, so that the coaster car will have enough energy to safely make it through the entire ride."
176,It transforms itself from one to the another and that is why the PE and KE effect the TE.
774,The initial drop height needs to be greater than the hill height because there needs to be enough PE to transfer into KE in order for the roller coaster car to make it over the hill.
583,"I recommend this for a couple of a different reasons, firstly, at this height, we will get the maximum amount of potential energy."
527,"E1: During my proposal to the Gonzales family, I will be sharing my findings about:"
733,"and in a frictionless world, they would just transfer back and forth from each other throughout the coaster."
178,"I know this because in my data, the more the cart mass, the more PE it has which means the more KE it has."
638,"The initial height would be 3.60 meters tall, the weight of the coaster would be 60kg to give the most speed through the ride."
440,"When you have a greater amount of potential energy, you will in turn have a greater amount of kinetic energy."
399,The reason why i think the initial drop should be 5 meters is so that the cart has enough energy to make it over the 4 meter hill.
596,because in one of my test with a drop height of 5m meters and a hill height of 5 meters the kart didnt make it over the hill so we need the hill to be lower than the initial drop.
149,Fourth and lastly I wanted to talk about mass and energy relating to our roller coaster.
693,When The PE is greater so is the KE.
117,But when we had out hill also at 5 meters the cart failed to go over because it didn't have enough energy form the 5 meter drop to go over it.
172,"This is because the initial height (4.75) did not have enough energy, nor was tall enough, to push the cart all the way up and down the hill."
298,For example when I had a drop height of 2.5 m the PE at the top of the drop was 1222 J and the KE was 0 J.
498,This clearly shows that the PE did not get destroyed but it was transferred into the KE throughout the drop.
684,"If the hill height is the same size or bigger than the initial drop, then the initial drop won't have enough energy to get over the hill."
119,You should use our design because we added fun and successful hills into our coaster.
469,When you have a hill that is a great height to make it over then it will be perfect for the roller coaster.
398,"An idea for a roller coaster is that they can use a boost to boost the cart up 5 meters and add a few hills starting at 4, then 3.5, then 3, and so on until 2."
342,I have a proposal for the design of your roller coaster.
356,A roller coaster is much more fun with swerves and bumps.
313,In this essay I will explain why I made my design like this.
505,Then when the car mass was 50kg the PE at the top was 2445J and the KE at the bottom was 2444J.
148,"Showing the PE at the top will be similar to the KE at the bottom, and the total energy all throughout."
220,"Whatever PE you have at the top of the initial drop is going to be the same as the total energy.When there was a initial drop height of 3.5 m there was 1710 PE and 0 KE, but once you got to the bottom there was 1 PE and 1709 KE and a total of 1710 energy."
242,So this is why it starts with s certain amount of energy which then transform to another.
550,So you can see when you add PE and KE it will owes equal the Total Energy
397,A way that they can make it more fun is adding more twist and turns to their roller coasters.
305,But when I had an initial drop height of 5 m and a hill height of 4 m it was able to go over the hill.
523,So that is why it is better to have a higher drop height and car mass but it is better to have a lower hill height so your car makes it to the end.
798,This is because we want the most PE at the top of the drop as well as the most KE at the bottom of the drop.
620,E1R: The drop height of my roller coaster is 5 meters.
680,The law of conservation of energy states that Energy can not be destroyed so The law of conservation of mass and Energy transformation work together.
626,"E1: Dear, The Gonzalez Family"
730,and the relationship between KE and PE.
797,E1: The drop height for my roller coaster is going to be 5 meters.
152,When we tested the cart mass at 60 it got to the bottom easily because it was heavier vs when we tested it at 40 then it took longer to go down the track.
507,This simulation is obviously done without friction but if there was friction it would effect the amount of PE and KE between the top of the drop and the bottom of the drop.
641,To make people scared we should make fast speeds which could be made by weight of the coaster and height of the ride.
791,"At the bottom, however, the energy changed to KE because the car was in motion and the PE has fewer joules because there was less stored energy."
269,The relation ship between PE and KE is there both an energy.
428,When compared to a drop height of 5 meters the PE joules at the top were 2668 and the KE at the bottom was 2666 joules.
62,The reason for this is that we think it will be most exciting for the riders because it was the highest option and also because you will gain the most speed from dropping from that height than you would on anything lower.
265,For 51 kg it was a PE of 2484 J and for the car mass of 40 kg it was 1956 J.
157,"I know this because in my testing data, the lower the hill compared to the initial drop, the more total energy there is."
754,Why potential and kinetic energy are so important it makes not only the coaster fun but function.
600,"When I made the drop height 5 meters, the PE was 2932."
223,You need to make sure you have a initial drop height taller than the hill height if you want the cart to get over.
757,The relationship of these being one cannot exist without the other as they are dependent on one another.
551,"E1: Dear Gonzales family, I think you should pick my design for the roller coaster you want to put in your park and here is why."
602,"Similarly, at the bottom of a drop height of 2 meters, the KE was 1173."
123,When we tested the cart mass at 60 it got to the bottom easily because it was heavier vs when we tested it at 40 then it took longer to go down the track.
817,This shows that if you increase one the other also increases.
486,In my simulator when I tested the 5.00 drop and the 5.00 hill the cart didn't make it over.
814,Another example of this is when I had a 5 meter initial drop and a 5 meter hill the car could not make it over the hill because it did not have enough energy from the top of the initial drop.
357,But I recommend the design is conscious about the affect hills have on the coaster.
327,Because at the initial drop the PE was 2448 J and the KE was 0 J.
60,We also noticed that when the mass was lower it sometimes wouldn't make it up hills or get all the way through.
556,I found that the initial drop height should be high because there will be more energy that is being produced over the drop.
631,Sincerely
135,In a roller coaster we all know there are many ups and downs to make it more fun for the rider in our roller coaster we added a hill after the drop out hill is 2 meters tall.
216,"Initial drop height can effect what happens to the KE, PE, and total energy."
285,"And this is because of the relation between mass and energy, the more mass an object has, the more potential energy it has"
712,This will give their passengers the best most fun experience as well as a safe ride.
670,E1: I think the drop height of the roller coaster should be 5 meters tall.
655,And about half the PE it had at the top of the drop making it safer.
471,As soon as the cart gets over the hill the potential energy starts to decrease again.
385,The drop height and hill height of the track is related because the drop is a measure of energy and the hill is a measure of PE.
577,I found that the initial drop height should be high because there will be more TE that is being produced over the drop.
182,E2R: My teams roller coaster design will be exciting and make it to the end without stopping because it has many drops that are bigger than the loops.
206,"For example, one of my carts had the mass of 60 and had the PE of 2790 and the KE of 2772."
286,E1: Greetings Gonzales family as you know I have made a design for your roller coaster.
376,More KE means more speed and time on the ride.
642,"Another way to make fear is to add inversions, if you combine inversions and speed people would have enough fun to ride on the coaster again."
197,"I know this because in my data I collected, My 5.00m hill had 2327 PE and 2 KE, meanwhile my 3.15m hill had 2324 PE and 777 KE."
390,The height and hill height of the track is related because the drop is a measure of energy and the hill is a measure of PE.
165,The higher the drop means more PE at the top of the ride and more KE at the bottom.
517,"For example, when i tested the hill height of 2 the PE at the top of the hill was 964."
737,In a model when the PE (potential energy) is higher the KE (kinetic energy) is smaller.
236,"Whatever PE you have at the top of the initial drop is going to be the same as the total energy.When there was a initial drop height of 3.5 m there was 1710 PE and 0 KE, but once you got to the bottom there was 1 PE and 1709 KE and a total of 1710 energy."
453,But when my hill was at 4m with my initial drop being 5m the cart made it to the end.
317,It had a total energy of 1222 J.
345,Doing this will give the cart more energy.
474,At the top the potential energy is the total energy and the KE is 0. then as the cart goes down the potential energy is 0 and the kinetic energy is the total.
484,In the roller coaster simulation the highest drop (5.00) had the total energy of 2443 and it was all potential energy at the top of the drop.
270,PE is at the start or top of the ride.
796,Also when the initial drop height was 4 m the TE was 1955 J at the start and 1955 J at the end.
661,That is the reason why the Gonzales family should choose my roller coaster.
588,"My second recommendation is a kart mass of 51kg, mass and energy have direct relationship."
438,"E1: The Gonzales family should have a high initial drop, a hill shorter than the initial drop and a heavy car."
630,"The initial height would be 120-150 feet, the weight of the coaster would be 80-100 kilograms to give the most speed through the ride."
829,"My data shows this because when the drop height was 5 m, the PE was 2,688 J, but when I decreased the initial drop height to 4 meters, the PE decreased to 2,150 J."
768,comparing hill heights the cart actually had 590 more joules of potential energy when it was a 4m hill than a 5m one.
697,"Even when a car has friction, friction creates non-useful energy no energy was destroyed it is just transferred into new energy."
106,"Here I will prove to you all of the things I just said with data from test runs, logic, and the relation ships between energy and the track."
301,Then at the bottom of the drop the PE was 1 J and the KE was 1442 J and the total energy was 1443 J.
192,The higher the drop means more PE at the top of the ride and more KE at the bottom.
650,Because it is tall will attract an audience so will attract more people and they will make more money.
35,We are constantly changing and modifying are roller coaster to be the safest it could possibly be so then we do not have problems and the people can enjoy the coaster.
205,"I know this because in my data, the more the cart mass, the more PE it has which means the more KE it has."
699,The initial drop should be 5 because that is the highest it can be for the roller coaster to be fun and safe.
687,"When at 50 kg the PE was 2448 and the KE was 2444, but when at 60 kg the PE was at 2937 and the KE was 2932."
786,"Then at the bottom the PE was 1 J and the KE was 1,554."
116,In our test drops when we had our hill at 2 meters the cart went over it without a problem because it had enough energy form our 5 meter drop to go over the 2 meter hill.
299,At the bottom of the drop the PE was 1 J and the KE was 1221 J and the total energy was 1222 J.
575,I hope you pick it because it will be the best design for the park and your customers.
718,Also the more KE there will be throughout the ride.
247,"And depending on the height of the initial drop can determine the amount of PE, KE, and total energy from a roller coaster."
496,"For example, when the initial drop height was 4m then the PE was 1955J and the KE was 0J."
501,When I did a hill height of 3m an initial drop height of 4m the roller coaster made it over.
688,E1R: I think the drop height of the roller coaster should be 5 meters tall.
262,For the 3 m it went over because the PE on the initial drop was more than the PE on the top of the hill.
4,We got rid of friction.
735,E1: I want the height of the initial drop to be 5.
120,Third and lastly I wanted to talk about mass and energy relating to our roller coaster.
511,E1: The drop height of my roller coaster design is 5 meters.
627,I think the best roller coaster we could build would be a roller coaster with three hills and two inversions.
52,While the cart goes down the drop the potential starts to decrease very quickly and the kinetic energy number increases really quickly because the cart is moving and not just sitting still.
32,We also are adding many different things to make the ride scary but extremely fun and safe.
240,When the energy transforms from PE to KE this is called the LAw of Conservation of Energy.
162,"In the beginning, you go through a dark tunnel then unexpectedly have a huge drop giving you that adrenaline rush."
27,We have made this roller coaster to be the safest and the most fun roller coaster so then it is fun and reliable and safe so then we can prevent the bad things that may happen during the roller coaster.
721,And when you are going down the drop the PE will all change into KE because the less height you have the less PE there will be.
281,"In short, out design would be the most exciting, and safe roller coaster that you can have."
609,They never don't equal the total energy (when there is no friction).
476,This goes with the Law of Conservation.
351,"Not to be confused with weight, mass is how much there is of an object."
526,When one form of energy is transformed to another no energy is destroyed in the process.
495,"At the start of the drop, the PE is greater than the KE but when it is at the end of the drop, the KE was greater than the PE."
622,"At the top of the drop, the total energy will equal the PE."
167,"Because one of our hills are smaller than the other, it is more likely for the cart to get to the end."
76,"So, for example, energy throughout a roller coaster is not getting destroyed it's either switching or the friction is turning into mechanical energy which turns into other forms of energy like heat+ thermal energy, and sound energy."
587,Which we obtain by having a high drop height.
155,E1: My teams roller coaster design will be exciting and make it to the end without stopping because it has many drops that are bigger than the loops.
818,I understand that in the real world we do have friction but for my data and explanations it was taken place in a frictionless world.
646,The best way to make the coaster safe is to make sure we have the right speed.
80,Yesterday when we were doing trials with different car masses my group noticed that the higher the mass was the more energy.
14,We also are adding many different things to make the ride scary but extremely fun and safe.
188,"Knowing that most people who go on roller coasters love the fast ones, we made ours fast."
42,The reason for this is that we think it will be most exciting for the riders because it was the highest option and also because you will gain the most speed from dropping from that height than you would on anything lower.
615,"Then, when I changed the hill height to 5 meters, with still a drop height of 5 meters, the car couldn't make it over the hill."
478,The last thing you need for your roller coaster is the mass of the cart.
224,"And depending on the height of the initial drop can determine the amount of PE, KE, and total energy from a roller coaster."
261,From out data we tested 5 m and 3 m. For the initial drop we decided on 5 m. First we tested 5 m for the hill height and it did not go over because the PE was the same as it was on top of the Hill.
61,E1R: We are starting our rollercoaster drop height at 5m.
417,E1: The drop height for my coaster destine is 250 meters.
358,My second experiment provided trials on how high a hill can be an the cart still makes it over the top and to the end.
310,E1R: Greetings Gonzales family as you know I have made a design for your roller coaster.
576,"E1R: Dear Gonzales family, you should pick my design for the roller coaster you want to put in your park and here is why."
570,In my trials I found that when the mass was 45 kg the total energy was 1992 J.
841,Those are my recommendations for what we should do with the roller coaster.
329,The amount of total energy depends on how much PE and KE there is.
241,This states that energy can not be destroyed or created.
194,"Because one of our hills are smaller than the other, it is more likely for the cart to get to the end."
702,When the initial drop was 5 meters there was more potential energy at the top of the drop and more kinetic energy at the bottom so that means more total energy than the smaller drops.
506,This shows that the more mass the car has the more PE and KE.
592,kinetic energy and total energy so in order to make the ride fun and safe this is the best way to do it.
128,"First our design works well, our design was built with speed and success in mind."
714,In other words the higher the hill height the higher the total energy.
492,"For an example, when the initial drop was 3m, then the PE at the top was 1466J and the KE was 0J which equal 1466TE."
1,We calculated the perfect amount of potential energy and kinetic energy to make the ride safe and fun at the same time.
780,"If the energy can't be created or destroyed, then where did this energy come from?"
710,Of course this is all in a friction-less scenario but in the real world there will be friction.
100,When the hill height was 3m the car made it over the hill but when the height was increased to 5m the car could not make it over the hill.
246,You need to make sure you have a initial drop height taller than the hill height if you want the cart to get over.
34,We have added many different twist and turns but are concerned that we may not have enough speed to get through the entire roller coaster.
633,"Hello Gonzalez Family, in this letter I will show you how to make the most fun and scariest ride for your park."
538,2444 J of total energy at the end of the ride.
569,"I found that the more mass there was in the car, the more energy there was."
463,When thinking of a roller coaster hill they usually give you air time and are really fun after the initial drop.
112,So you should use our design because we have a higher drop and the roller coaster cart makes it to the end of the track successfully.
420,When compared to a drop height of 5 meters the PE joules at the top was 2668 and the KE at the bottom was 2666 joules.
713,E1R: We should start the roller coaster at 5 meters for the initial drop.
436,"for example, with a cart mass of 40kg the PE at the top of the drop would be at 1957 joules compared to a mass of 60kg where the PE would be 2936 joules of energy."
300,When I had a drop height of 5 m the PE at the top was 2443 J and the KE was 0 J.
13,We are constantly adding to ideas and things we can changes to make this ride enjoyable.
387,This our idea Gonzales family.
765,The hill height is also important as its height is greatly dependent on the drops.
487,But when I tested the 5.00 drop and the 2.00 it would be a boring ride.The best option to put the hill at is 4.25 because it was shorter than the 5.00 initial drop but high enough to still be thrilling.
335,Then I have a hill of 3 m to end it off.
199,"This is because the initial height (4.75) did not have enough energy, nor was tall enough, to push the cart all the way up and down the hill."
838,"The reason this is needed is because if the heights of the hill and the initial drop are equal, the car won't have enough energy to make it up the hill, because energy can't be created."
603,"Then, at the bottom of a drop height of 5 meters, the KE was 2932."
821,So when the the height is increased so does the energy and we want the maximum energy so we also want the maximum height.
629,There would be enough potential energy to get over all hills and inversions.
302,Now for an example of why the hill height has to be shorter I will show you some more evidence.
716,"For example, if the drop height is 5 meters the PE is 2932 but if the drop is 2 meters 1173 that's why there will be more excitement the roller coaster will be more for the passengers."
711,"The best option for the Gonzales family would be 5 meters for the initial drop, 4 meters for the hill, and finally 60 kg for the mass of the cart."
227,For example when the initial drop height is 5 m and the hill height is 5 m the cart can not make it over.
591,"E1R: For what your requesting, I recommend we have a drop height of 5 meters."
635,"Both inversions would come after the two of the hills, which would add extra fear because if the coaster has speed while also being upside down it would make riders have fun."
70,The total energy was then 977J because that was them added together.
590,kinetic energy and total energy so in order to make the ride fun and safe this is the best way to do it
709,Also for the mass of the cart there will be more total energy which means more kinetic energy and potential energy if the mass is the greatest it can be.
311,"I think the initial drop height should be 5 m, then have a hill that is 4 m tall, then a loop 4 m tall, and at the end a hill 3 m tall."
21,So then it can make it up the 4 meter tall hill.
384,It transfers to thermal energy.
574,"The roller coaster should have a higher initial drop height, a hill that is lower than the initial drop, and a mass that is heavy."
193,The PE and KE also is affected when the cart goes up and down our hills.
339,But when the car mass was 2937.
230,Compared to a cart that has a heavier mass.
485,"For example, when the hill was 4.25, at the top the PE was 2083 and the KE was 365 equaling to 2448."
521,"For example, when i tested the car mass at 40kg, the PE was only 1578 joules."
614,"For example, the drop height was 5 meters and the hill was 3 meters, the car made it over the hill with ease."
431,"At the initial drop of 5 meters, the PE is at 2668 joules but at the bottom of the drop, the PE is at 0."
378,"This means that during the ride, the total energy available will stay the same."
158,"This is because the cart doesn't need as much energy to go around these loops or hills when they're smaller vs when they're bigger, also giving it more total energy."
121,The mass of the cart effects the energy that the cart has for the ride.
470,When the cart is nearing the top of the hill the potential and kinetic energy evens out to equal the total energy.
108,In our roller coaster design we start off with a high 5 meter drop that will give the roller coaster cart enough energy to follow through with the rest of the coaster.
573,"You should choose my safe, fun and, exciting roller coaster."
405,"Regarding the mass of the cart, I would say to have it at 55kg because you have more PE at the top of the hill."
258,Since there is no friction that law is true but if there was then it would turn into TE which is energy we can't use to make the cart move.
581,In my trials I found that when the mass was 45 kg the TE was 1992 J.
147,"Like when we tested the initial drop the PE at the top was 2443, The KE at the bottom was 2442 and the total energy was 2433."
789,E1R: The height of the roller coaster's initial drop should be 5 meters.
20,We also got the perfect amount of energy at the bottom of the coaster.
88,The mass of the car should be 60kg.
129,In our roller coaster design we start off with a high 5 meter drop that will give the roller coaster cart enough energy to follow through with the rest of the coaster.
331,And the more PE there is at the top the more KE there is at the bottom of the drop.
547,"When I used a car that had a mass of 40 kg, the roller coaster had 1958 J of total energy."
125,That is the end of my letter to you I hope this helps you decide that our design is the best and it will work very well.
