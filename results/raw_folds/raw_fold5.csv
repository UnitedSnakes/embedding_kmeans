In our roller coaster design we start off with a high 5 meter drop that will give the roller coaster cart enough energy to follow through with the rest of the coaster.,P5_07_09_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable

Seconded I want to talk about how our roller coaster works well because of the hill.,P5_07_09_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
In a roller coaster we all know there are many ups and downs to make it more fun for the rider in our roller coaster we added a hill after the drop out hill is 2 meters tall.,P5_07_09_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
Our hill is 2 meters tall so that the roller coaster cart can get over it and it wont stop mid way.,P5_07_09_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
In our test drops when we had our hill at 2 meters the cart went over it without a problem because it had enough energy form our 5 meter drop to go over the 2 meter hill.,P5_07_09_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable

The mass of the cart effects the energy that the cart has for the ride.,P5_07_09_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
Our car mass is 60 because the more mass the cart has the more energy it has to go faster and farther.,P5_07_09_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,acceptable
When we tested the cart mass at 60 it got to the bottom easily because it was heavier vs when we tested it at 40 then it took longer to go down the track.,P5_07_09_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable

In our roller coaster design we start off with a high 5 meter drop that will give the roller coaster cart enough energy to follow through with the rest of the coaster.,P5_07_09_22-23,E1R,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable

So when that cart fell from 5 meters the PE at the top was 2443.,P5_07_09_22-23,E1R,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
When we dropped the roller costar cart from 2 meters it didn't go as fast or as far and make it to the end of the track because the PE at the top was 977.,P5_07_09_22-23,E1R,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable

In a roller coaster we all know there are many ups and downs to make it more fun for the rider in our roller coaster we added a hill after the drop out hill is 2 meters tall.,P5_07_09_22-23,E1R,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
Our hill is 2 meters tall so that the roller coaster cart can get over it and it wont stop mid way.,P5_07_09_22-23,E1R,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
In our test drops when we had our hill at 2 meters the cart went over it without a problem because it had enough energy form our 5 meter drop to go over the 2 meter hill.,P5_07_09_22-23,E1R,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
But when we had out hill also at 5 meters the cart failed to go over because it didn't have enough energy form the 5 meter drop to go over it.,P5_07_09_22-23,E1R,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable

I think the initial drop height should be 60 m and then have a hill that is 50 m tall and I will explain to you why I think this.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
You said you wanted an exciting roller coaster so I made the drop height 60 m. I didn't want to make it too tall and have it take up too much space but I also didn't want it to be boring.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
Then there will be a hill of 50 m. The reason I have the hill as 50 m is because a hill has to be shorter than initial drop height because otherwise there won't be enough energy to go over the hill.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,acceptable,unacceptable
For example when I did an Initial Drop height of 5 m and had a hill height of 5 m it didn't go over the hill because it did not have enough energy.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
For example when I had a drop height.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
The amount of energy there is depends on how much PE and KE there is.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
Because PE and KE added together equal the total amount of energy.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,acceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
And the initial drop affects the amount of PE because the higher the drop height the larger amount of PE there is.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,acceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
And the more PE there is at the top the more KE there is at the bottom of the drop because all the PE from the top transfers to KE.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,acceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
This happens because the Law of Conservation of Energy which means that energy cannot be created or destroyed it can only be transferred.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,acceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable

You said you wanted an exciting roller coaster so I made the drop height 5 m. You said you wanted an exciting ride so I put the drop height as 5 m. Because it was the highest it could be and it had the most energy.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
For example when I had a drop height of 2.5 the PE at the top was 1222 J and the KE was 0 J.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
At the bottom the KE was 1221 J and the PE was 1 J.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
It had a total energy of 1222 J.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable

Then there will be a hill of 4 m. The reason I have the hill as 4 m is because a hill has to be shorter than initial drop height because otherwise there won't be enough energy to go over the hill.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,acceptable,unacceptable

But when the hill height was 4 it was able to go over.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable

The amount of total energy depends on how much PE and KE there is.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
Because PE and KE added together equals the total amount of energy.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,acceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable

This is because all the PE from the top transfers to KE.,P6_03_07_22-23,E1,unacceptable,acceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable

You keep the same amount of energy the whole time so as long as you make the hill smaller the car will have enough energy to get up that hill.,P1_06_16_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
Another example of this is when I had a 5 meter initial drop and a 5 meter hill the car could not make it over the hill because it did not have enough energy from the top of the initial drop.,P1_06_16_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
