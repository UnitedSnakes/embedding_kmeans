For starters you will want a release height as high as you can have it.The higher you start your coaster the more total energy it has meaning it will have more potential and kinetic energy so it will go faster and farther.As shows in out data when when we released a coaster from a height of 5m the total energy was 2321J but when we released one from a height of 3.49m the total energy was only 1705J.,P5_04_08_22-23,E1,acceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable

So with this roller coaster you are trying to build.For us to build this roller coaster we need some safety requirements.Some of these will be or initial drop height or hill height even the weight of our car these will make the energy change and be bigger and smaller.,P5_06_17_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
First we will talk about or roller coasters initial drop and hill height.For our heights we will have to make our initial drop height taller than our hill height.,P5_06_17_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,acceptable,unacceptable
The reason for this is because with the first drop we need to create a amount of energy to get over the hill so if our hill is the same height or taller than the initial drop or car will not get over.,P5_06_17_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
Here is some evidence we did some tests we keep or initial drop height at 5.00 meters.So we put or hill height at 4.01 meters and it created 2448 Joules of energy and made it over the hill.But when we put the hill height at 5.00 meters it created more energy that was 2449 joules of energy and it didn't make it over the hill.,P5_06_17_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
So this shows that our hill height needs to be smaller than the initial drop height.,P5_06_17_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
We do need some things that might help our roller coaster to be fun.,P5_06_17_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
We might want our initial drop height to be pretty tall it would create lots of Potential energy at the top of the drop and it will turn into ken-tic energy at the bottom.,P5_06_17_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
While this energy transfers between kinetic and potinel because we cant destroy or create energy can only transfer it that is what the law of conversation of energy says.,P5_06_17_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,acceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
This will create more energy for this coaster to be more fun and have more inversions.,P5_06_17_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
Also if our car weighs more it will create more energy and will help that too we did some experiences to show that the car will create more energy if it weighs more.,P5_06_17_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,acceptable

Also when the car goes down the initial drop the energy starts out as potential at the top of the hill but when it starts going down it transfers to kinetic energy.Here is some evidence we did some tests we keep or initial drop height at 5.00 meters.So we put or hill height at 4.01 meters and it created 2448 Joules of energy and made it over the hill.But when we put the hill height at 5.00 meters it created more energy that was 2449 joules of energy and it didn't make it over the hill.,P5_06_17_22-23,E1,unacceptable,acceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable

Here are my findings from our research on rollercoasters.,P5_03_03_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
"First, we did the initial drop we learned that potential energy turned into kinetic energy.",P5_03_03_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
Then we studied hills and we learned if the hill is the same height or bigger than the initial drop the cart doesn't have enough kinetic energy to make it over the hill.,P5_03_03_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,acceptable,unacceptable
Then we did mass and energy we learned that the heavier carts had more energy than the lighter carts.,P5_03_03_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,acceptable
But my takeaway on how to make the longest roller coaster is having a big first drop that has a lot of potential energy that can be turned into kinetic energy.,P5_03_03_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
So you can have a long fun and thrilling ride.,P5_03_03_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable

"First, we did the initial drop we learned that potential energy turned into kinetic energy as stated in trials 1,2,3, and 4 in trial 1 there was 2443 pe and 0 ke but at the bottom, there were 2443 ke and 0 pe.",P5_03_03_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
Then we studied hills and we learned if the hill is the same height or bigger than the initial drop the cart doesn't have enough kinetic energy to make it over the hill we also learned that the bigger the hill the more pe as shown with test trials with 5m and 4m hills 5 had 2443 Jules and 4 had 1961 Jules.,P5_03_03_22-23,E1,acceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,acceptable,unacceptable
Then we did mass and energy we learned that the heavier carts had more energy than the lighter carts as shown in mass vs energy.,P5_03_03_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,acceptable
so to have a big ride that is fun you have to have a lot of potential energy at the top of the initial hill and a lot of kinetic energy at the bottom of the initial hill so I think that 5m would be the best hill for that potential energy to be turned into kinetic energy.,P5_03_03_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
E1: My recommendation to you Gionzales family is you make your intial drop height 5m tall.,P6_03_05_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
Your hill is going to have to be less then the height of your intial drop so I would recommend a height of about 3m.,P6_03_05_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,acceptable,unacceptable
For the mass of you car I recommend about 60kg in weight based on my investigations.,P6_03_05_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable

I don't even recommend having it super high because the higher it is the less kinetic energy you have making the ride go slower that's why I recommend 3m.,P6_03_05_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
According to my trials the hill of 3m had 1768J of potential energy and 582J of kinetic where as 4.5 had 2276J potential energy but only 73J of kinetic energy.,P6_03_05_22-23,E1,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable,unacceptable
